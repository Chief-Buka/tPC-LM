0,are tourists enticed by these attractions threatening their very existence
1,the two young sealions took not the slightest interest in our arrival
2,they were playing on the jetty rolling over and tumbling into the water together entirely ignoring the human beings edging awkwardly round them
3,our party then had to step gingerly over hundreds of marine iguanas basking on the rocks strange creatures with richly coloured velvet coats looking like something between a giant lizard and a miniature dinosaur and found nowhere else on earth except here in the galapagos
4,a little further on were the bluefooted boobies birds with brilliant chinablue feet again unique
5,and then there were the flightless cormorants birds with vestigial wings who over the generations have lost the ability to fly because the nutrients at the shoreline are so rich they have no need to leave
6,the island of fernandina lies at the far western edge of the galapagos archipelago dominated by a volcano that last erupted only six years ago and home to some of the most remarkable wildlife in the world
7,it was late afternoon on one of the last days of the year and we had come ashore to scramble round the rough dark lava rocks of punta espinosa on the island
8,in the golden afternoon light with the moon rising above the volcanoes on isabela island across the strait we could be forgiven for thinking that we were guests in paradise
9,the creatures you see in the galapagos are remarkable in their rarity
10,they are even more so for their lack of fear
11,they donot run away
12,they carry on basking or playing or mating or incubating their eggs or fighting for territory with blissful disregard for human beings
13,it is as if you are walking into a david attenborough programme and finding that the real thing is even better than you ever imagined
14,the closeness of the living natural world in this environment of volcanic rock and sweeping beaches and sparse vegetation makes the galapagos experience special
15,the colours help too
16,the intense black of the rock the startling blue of sea and sky the crimson of the mating frigatebirds the yellow of the warblers the brilliant orange of the american oystercatchers the glistening silver of hundreds of dolphins swooping round your ship in the dawn light
17,we spent eight days in all aboard a boat called tropic sun visiting all parts of the islands
18,we lived ate and slept on the boat and went ashore two or three times a day to walk the trails see the wildlife and snorkel in the sea
19,the boat was hardly the most luxurious experience wed ever had and was certainly not a centre of gastronomic excellence
20,but that really wasnot the point
21,it took us to the places we wanted to see and the expert guide we had who led us round the trails and explained the flora and fauna to us was the best we could possibly have wanted
22,you need not be an inveterate birdwatcher or naturalist to be captivated by what you see
23,you simply cannot help being taken over by a sense of wonder at this different and special world
24,darwins visit in aboard hms beagle lasted five times longer
25,he marvelled at the tortoises and the iguanas but it was the tiny finches that jolted his imagination most vividly
26,they are still called darwins finches in his honour
27,there are different species of the finches across the islands our group managed to see five or six
28,the fascination is in the beaks
29,each species on each island has over time developed a differently shaped beak adapted to the vegetation and the competition in that particular location
30,these tiny birds with tiny distinctions helped to produce one of the greatest ever advances in the history of scientific thought
31,since darwin called these islands on the equator have struggled to maintain the fragile balance of their ecology
32,over the years the indigenous animal population has been under increasing threat from wayward fishermen or from feral dogs goats and rats escaping from human settlements or boats
33,recently the ecuador authorities started trying to eradicate the invading species and have now succeeded in freeing some entire islands from nonnative creatures
34,a giant tortoise breeding programme is in place rearing infants in a protected environment at a time when they are at greatest risk and then returning them to the wild
35,and there are strict laws now in place against harming or destroying the wildlife though only recently a group of slain tortoises was discovered killed apparently for the japanese aphrodisiac market
36,the most serious ecological threat however is posed by the greatest economic boon the islands have ever had tourism
37,ninety boats ranging in size from passengers to do the rounds of the islands
38,and on the whole the schedules are managed well
39,the itineraries are staggered so that at most two or three boats might appear at one location at the same time
40,when you go ashore you have to be with a guide you cannot stray from the marked trails and you cannot touch the wildlife
41,one of the passengers on our boat was roundly and rightly chastised for stroking a young sealion an action with potentially fatal consequences for the sealion because of the risk of rejection by the mother
42,in a country as poor as ecuador the temptation to increase the numbers of tourists is always there
43,we were told theres been a recent request for permission for a much larger boat to travel round the galapagos carrying some passengers
44,i shudder to think what might happen if such a boat arrived at punta espinosa and disgorged everyone on to fernandina island at the same time
45,not only would the shock of a thousand tramping feet endanger the rock the sand and the teeming wildlife that depends on it but it would seriously degrade the quality of the visitors own experience
46,herein lies one of the oldest dilemmas about the evolution of tourism
47,we value and to want to visit the unique and fragile environments of the world
48,yet in visiting we risk destroying the very qualities that render those places so enticing
49,this is especially true where the rarity of the place is quite so marked as it is in the galapagos
50,responsible tourism lies in absolute respect for the location and its inhabitants
51,it lies in treading carefully wherever we go
52,it lies in ensuring that the economic contribution we make by going helps to conserve rather than to destroy
53,and it lies in developing the international networks protecting endangered species and world heritage so that they can make a difference on the ground
54,fortunately in the galapagos charles darwin would recognise much of what he saw if he returned today
55,it is our duty to ensure that he would recognise it again another two centuries hence
56,for the last three weeks there has been an utterly inexplicable rise in the prison population of about prisoners a week
57,the words of martin narey the directorgeneral of the prison service ought to prompt more than the customary political panic
58,by this morning the prison population which seemed to have stabilised at around in the late 1980s and early 1990s will have passed the mark
59,although the causes of the surge of the past three weeks have baffled those who might know the underlying trend a rise in the number of prisoners of since this time last year is utterly explicable and indeed was predicted
60,prison policy in the uk has been an uphill slalom for the past halfcentury
61,politicians under pressure to do something about crime pass laws and write guidelines requiring more criminals to be imprisoned for more crimes for longer
62,every now and then however there is a crisis as the walls of our prisons begin to bow under the weight of numbers contained therein
63,politicians then scrabble around for tough alternatives to jail which they try to sell to a sceptical public educated only in a simple lockemup logic that reached its conclusion in the bonejarring stupidity of michael howards prison works slogan
64,the prisonbuilding programme then catches up with the prison population and we resume the zigzag which has given us the least successful prison policy in europe
65,the election of a labour government committed to being tough on the causes of crime was a chance to break this self defeating sequence
66,unfortunately tony blairs first home secretary jack straw lacked the courage to seize it
67,david blunkett is a more adventurous figure and shows some signs of being willing to challenge the assumptions of the past but he still poses too often for the unitive gallery
68,at least he will have no difficulty in rejecting a demand from the prison governors association to take away from magistrates altogether the power to hand down custodial sentences
69,but will he use this crisis to ask deeper questions about why so many people are in prison and whether they should be
70,one of the causes of the rise in the prison population in the past seven years has been the growth of illegal drug use with crack cocaine a particular problem
71,this weeks suggestion that shock tactics should be used to discourage young people from trying heroin is off the point
72,information is important but the interplay between the desire to escape reality and addiction is more complex than a simple pavlovian model
73,medicalising addiction rather than keeping it in the criminal underworld offers the best hope both of controlling harddrug use and of limiting the effect on crime
74,if people who have problems with illegal drugs alcohol or mental health were taken out of our prisons there would be hardly anyone left
75,when it comes to the wider causes of crime however one of the best places to start is prison itself
76,with per cent of inmates recorded as reoffending within two years of release prison clearly does not work
77,a brave home secretary would conclude that prison obviously reinforces many of the causes of crime
78,it breaks up families and usually gives prisoners nothing better to do than plan how not to get caught next time
79,all parties welcomed the woolf report of yet none has acted on it to improve the education service in prison
80,if schoolchildren can have life coaches why not prisoners
81,instead education angermanagement courses and anything constructive are often the first things to be cut when governors come under pressure to save money
82,our prison system is an affront to a civilised society as is witnessed by the number of legal actions brought by prisoners under the human rights act
83,even if the voters did not care about that they should care that it is a very expensive way of training criminals for more crime
84,many of the alternatives to prison may not result in much better reoffending rates but at least they are cheaper
85,mr blunkett should make the radically pragmatic case for the humane treatment of the nations criminals as a first step in tackling the causes of crime
86,heres something to chew over when pondering the growing problem of obese children
87,the fattest child in my daughters primary school class was also the cleverest
88,her mother came from kuala lumpur and latched onto me as a fellow eurasian when we waited to collect our children after school
89,far from being worried or embarrassed by hannahs humpty dumpty physique at seven her daughter weighed close to stone she was obviously proud of what she called hannahs very good size
90,at break while the others played football hannah sat on a bench absorbed in the readers digest or the ladybird guide to the solar system steadily working her way through a family size pack of mini mars bars
91,she came to tea once and explained why although the individual galaxies were constricting the universe itself was expanding
92,she wanted to be an astronaut
93,i had just come back from a press trip to hawaii where one morning all of us apart from a midlands radio presenter called kenny had been taken by helicopter to see some spectacular waterfalls
94,kenny couldnot come because the tour guide said he was too fat and would upset the balance of the helicopter
95,id told the children about kenny and hoped they wouldnot bring it up
96,they didnot because believe it or not they really hadnot noticed hannah was overweight
97,hannah the clever one theyd say not hannah shes fat
98,i wish this story had a happy ending for theres no reason why stories about fat people shouldnot
99,take kenny
100,from the neck down he looked like mr blobby but he had a surprisingly lean mean profile and a devastatingly sexy voice
101,women in the midlands wrote in every week to tell kenny how much they fancied him
102,when we got back from our waterfall trip we found him on the hotel terrace drinking beer and dealing with his fan mail
103,hannah iam sure could have ended up as content as kenny but at she was screwed up by the therapist her mother got hold of to help her lose weight
104,please note it wasnot hannah who wanted to look like kate moss it was her mother forcing her
105,from being a bright happy clever fat girl hannah became a depressed neurotic anorexic teenager who only read books about fashion and diets
106,i bumped into her mother the other day outside the post office
107,hows hannah
108,i said
109,she was at a health clinic in portugal doing alternate sessions of meditation and colonic irrigation said her mother
110,since the obesity report came out parents have been swamped with advice about how to control their childrens diets and lifestyle
111,the older i get the less iam convinced that we poor parents have any control over our children at all
112,this depressing opinion was confirmed by sir richard doll the first doctor to discover the link between cancer and smoking
113,he was on desert island discs and when sue lawley asked plaintively what parents could do to stop their children smoking sir richard said absolutely nothing
114,in fact he opined the more parents nagged at children not to smoke the more likely it was that they would
115,as long as they stopped in their midthirties they wouldnot die of lung cancer he thought and there was a very strong chance they would stop smoking as adults having weighed up all the evidence against it
116,iam sure the same argument applies to obesity
117,keep nagging at children to stop snacking switch off the television and take exercise the more they will guzzle and slump
118,waiting outside the fitting rooms of a kings road shop the other day i was surprised and dismayed not by how fat kids are these days but how unhealthily skinny they are especially teenage girls
119,the ones trying on crop tops and trousers looked less like nubile young women than scaffolding
120,if you want to see serious obesity go to miami airport
121,its more obvious out there because everyone is wearing shorts
122,the entire airport smells of cinnamon the preferred topping for all those doughnuts theyare selling
123,you see entire families sitting at doughnut stalls with buckets of doughnuts between their knees
124,now thats obesity
125,tony blair is engaged in low politics on foxhunting
126,the timing of this his third initiative seems to have been influenced by the need to get stephen byers through his trial by ordeal in the house of commons on tuesday
127,not only did it reward labour backbenchers for their show of loyalty but it helped move the media caravan on from the semantics of lying by presenting them with a new or rather renewed controversy
128,however labour backbenchers are not so stupid that they can be bought off with yet another meaningless vote that allows them to express their opinions and is then forgotten
129,equally public opinion which on this issue is wrong but unmistakable would not easily understand another marching of the abolitionist troops up the hill only for them to be marched down again
130,most people think that hunting with dogs is cruel that it should be banned and that the government should get on with it
131,the real low politics of mr blairs return to this subject therefore is that of reaching a compromise with the house of lords
132,whatever the presentational value with his own party of occasional confrontations with the forces of conservatism in red coats and on horseback the prime minister is unlikely to want to provoke another fulldress showdown with the countryside lobby
133,the last time he picked a fight with them the deputy prime minister and a protester had to be prised apart in a flowerbed in rhyl in the middle of a general election campaign
134,on march the commons will undoubtedly vote overwhelmingly again for a complete ban on hunting
135,if left to themselves the lords would just as overwhelmingly vote to leave things as they are
136,mr blair may hope that the threat of the parliament act which requires the will of the commons ultimately to prevail over that of the upper house will encourage the lords to opt for the compromise instead
137,getting the lords to decide that the middle way compromise scheme is the lesser of two evils depends however on the credibility of the threat to use the parliament act
138,the lords could call mr blairs bluff if they judge that he really would not want to have the socalled countryside march on whitehall again
139,this is no way to decide an issue of principle
140,the majority of people in britain confuse their distaste for a minority pursuit with the instinct that there ought to be a law against it
141,there should not be just as there should be no law against the rather more popular sport of angling
142,the undue attention devoted to one particular means of culling animals owes too much to the perceived class connotations of country sports and sanctimony about humans deriving pleasure from it
143,what requires legislation is the less visible cruelty towards factoryfarmed chickens and pigs and towards other animals in transit not to mention cruel and unnecessary experiments on primates
144,a compromise between a ban on hunting and no ban is dishonest
145,the idea of licensed or regulated cruelty makes no sense
146,it would be better if the prime minister and all those mps who vote for a ban simply to earn easy applause from a vocal and passionate minority of their constituents were courageous enough to explain to the voters that while some activities may offend our sensibilities they should not all be banned
147,the middle way is a classic blairite fudge
148,it is unlikely to satisfy either side although the antihunters are likely to be the more disappointed because hunting would continue with only some of its more repellent excesses curtailed
149,the prime minister would earn a great deal more respect if he said what he really thought and explained and defended that instead of trying to fix his way out of a political problem
150,today in the european parliaments chamber in brussels men and women from european nations will gather to begin discussing a constitutional settlement for europe
151,europe has a constitution now of course but in its various official languages it runs into literally millions of pages of legislation council decisions and commission directives known collectively as the acquis not exactly a household term in europes salons and saunas
152,this tangle of laws and regulations has long cried out to be formulated into a few simple rules with the paramount aim of bringing europe closer to its people as the jargon goes
153,the question is whether the constitutional convention now assembled under the leadership of the former french president valry giscard destaing is an appropriate vehicle to deliver a new constitutional settlement
154,certainly the choice of mr giscard to run things doesnot inspire a great deal of confidence
155,the fact that he is old should be no obstacle although his slightly sleazy past remember the bokassa diamonds scandal
156,detracts a little from his dignity
157,the more serious drawback with mr giscard is simply the suspicion that he will guide the convention in a direction that reflects the traditional french approach to governance not so much libert fraternit egalit as litisme dirigisme technocratie
158,that trinity was in fact very much the foundation of the institutions of the original european community as set out in the treaty of rome of
159,it was the vision of jean monnet and robert schumann the french founding fathers of the community and of the comit daction pour les etatsunis deurope that they founded
160,these arrangements worked well for the small community of the six but in a union of they are distinctly creaky
161,all agree that in a union of or the position we could easily be in before the decade is out such arrangements would be unsustainable
162,the danger is that mr giscard a typical product of the french lite will simply want to give us amore of the same but with a much stronger centre
163,that would mean a stronger commission and a leadership role for the big five france the uk germany italy and spain to cope with the demands of a 30state union
164,indeed worries about expansion leading to a wider but looser eu underlay the french governments past resistance to welcoming new members from scandinavia and the east
165,still there are reasons to be optimistic
166,mr giscard will not be able to have things all his own way in a 105member commission especially as the british are providing its chief executive in the form of sir john kerr a supermandarin and diplomat
167,and the laeken declaration that set up the convention declared that european institutions must be brought closer to citizens
168,they want them to be less unwieldy and more efficient and open
169,that cannot be ignored
170,by far the best way of ensuring that europe is brought closer to its people is to provide for a stronger european parliament
171,until that is done there is very little chance of a truly paneuropean party system developing and with that a european level of debate
172,more sessions of the european council should be open to the cameras and the public
173,and most importantly there should be a much stronger formal commitment to the principle of subsidiarity with more decisionmaking devolved to national regional and local levels
174,more than ever in a union of states europe should concentrate on performing the tasks in the economic environmental and even defence fields where it can make a difference
175,surely mr giscard has to understand that
176,the prospect of meeting an old but longseparated schoolfriend can trigger far more fear than joy
177,did the charismatic soul who thrilled your teenage self evolve into a bore a prig an oaf
178,worse did they never possess the virtues you innocently pinned to them
179,what applies to people applies in spades to literature
180,to reread a favourite author of ones youth is to court incredulity and even selfdisgust
181,how could i have rated that pretentious garbagesentimental schlock
182,around the age of i adored john steinbecks the grapes of wrath almost more than any other novel
183,soon enough i learnt this was an inadmissible affection
184,too folksy too naturalistic stylistically immature politically nave the hit squads of academic criticism had dropped down hard on steinbeck even before his death in
185,he was born in salinas california on february and next week allen lane publishes an ample selection of his nonfiction to mark the centenary of men and their making edited by susan shillinglaw and jackson j benson
186,of course i opened it with trepidation
187,would steinbeck prove as cringingly embarrassing as every other 15yearold crush
188,i need not have worried
189,of men and their making is a constant delight a generous openhearted vaudeville show of a book that switches from elegantly crafted memoirs to frivolous pieces on fishing or fords from thrilling reportage to sinewy meditations on politics and culture
190,not all of it is perfect or profound
191,steinbeck wrote reams of journalism over three decades and one leading item on the academic chargesheet states that he squandered too much talent on ephemera
192,but all in all his praise for mark twains incredible ear and eye and sense of form as a subjective observer goes for steinbeck too
193,here is the democratic american voice in all its glory friendly courageous compassionate keen to go everywhere see everything and capture it all in pacy spirited prose that can swing between high ideas and street life without missing a beat
194,the collection teems with hundreds of images and phrases that kick and bite and stay from the childhood memory of a phonograph that leaped from a shelf and destroyed itself in the california earthquake of to the vision of bob hope in london in wisecracking to a hospital ward of maimed soldiers and magically drawing laughter up out of the black water
195,we revisit the beautifullyevoked california towns of steinbecks youth and we follow him into the itinerant workers camps of the dust bowl years in articles that mount a ringing defence of the dignity of economic migrants
196,the editors choose some grittily memorable wartime reportage some charming accounts of postwar europe and portraits of his friends from woody guthrie and robert capa to henry fonda
197,watching john fords fine film of the grapes of wrath after years steinbeck is galvanised when this lean stringy darkfaced piece of electricity walked out on the screen
198,even the text of a photo book on america and americans written when he had allegedly gone soft is typically abrasive about his countrymens taste for narcissism and racism from the first we have treated our minorities abominably the way the old boys do the new kids in school
199,steinbeck was not always prescient like many other us liberals he supported the early stages of the war in vietnam
200,yet these pages rattle by without a snide thought a cheap shot or a dead sentence from beginning to end
201,at a time when establishment america takes on the sepulchral tones of donald rumsfeld or the silences of kenneth lay this book could achieve more for the nations prestige overseas than a hundred extra cia recruits
202,in the list of picture captions you never thought youd see in the pages of a serious newspaper 160millionyearold vomit is right up there with joan collins and her new husband also
203,but millionyearold vomit was precisely the caption in tuesdays papers relating to the thrilling discovery of fossilised dinosaur puke in a clay quarry near peterborough
204,lets leave to the panellists of have i got news for you the cheap gibe that the daily telegraph with a substantial number of fossils and dinosaurs among its readers was stirring nostalgia rather than publishing bona fide news
205,instead lets consider what a fabulous discovery this is beyond even steven spielbergs wildest dreams
206,professor peter doyle of the university of greenwich believes that the fossils found near peterborough are partlydigested shellfish regurgitated by ichthyosaurs marine reptiles
207,how he reached this conclusion is not the business of this column thank god not of course that the almighty has any place in palaeontology
208,but it is certainly interesting to dwell on the significance of his conclusion
209,for one thing it heaps enviable prestige upon peterborough which until this week had only its handsome norman cathedral to boast about
210,but there arenot too many places in the world able to demonstrate proof that an ichthyosaur once chundered somewhere in the vicinity
211,thinking about it though it is quite possible that the people of peterborough would rather not adopt this as a claim to fame just as the townsfolk of slough tend not to put it about that john betjeman once wrote a poem about them
212,as for the vomiting side of the equation i donot know if youve noticed but throwingup has been looming large in popular culture
213,billy connolly was one of the first to draw attention to it wondering why drunkards being sick call so despairingly for ralph and huey
214,and although vomiting was one of the last human bodily functions to get a regular airing on television rare is the drama now that does not feature at least one person spewing into a toilet
215,certainly no selfrespecting soap lets new years eve go without a character chucking up after too much alcohol we have even had animated vomit on the simpsons
216,i mention this because until now palaeontology has rubbed shoulders with popular culture only in the bbc series walking with dinosaurs which as brilliant as it was tended to drag once youd marvelled at the special effects for long enough and in the irritating form of ross in the sitcom friends
217,but professor doyles discovery changes everything
218,i have a sixyearold son who knows the difference between a protoceratops and a diplodocus like he knows the difference between baked beans and strawberry jam
219,however he has been to the natural history museum dozens of times and it no longer lights his fire
220,when i told him about the ichthyosaur pebbledashing parts of cambridgeshire with shellfish however he was all ears
221,he was plainly enthralled by the idea that anything jurassic might behave in the same way as he did the other night after a tummy bug brought up his spaghetti bolognese
222,might behave better still like bart simpson
223,what is needed now is for an enterprising childrens telly producer perhaps the person behind that sickeningly cute dinosaur barney to make a show about twin ichthyosaurs called ralph and huey
224,and the thought also occurs that some graduate student might want to consider a thesis on the enthralling history of vomit
225,i was once shown round a vomitorium where middleclass romans went to bring back their dinners
226,it was fascinating
227,but i canot for the life of me remember where it was
228,for peterboroughs sake not there i hope
229,the decision of the human fertility and embryology authority hfea to allow a couple to select genetically their next baby was bound to raise concerns that advances in biotechnology are racing ahead of our ability to control the consequences
230,the couple at the centre of this case have a son who suffers from a potentially fatal disorder and whose best hope is a marrow transplant from a sibling so the stakes of this decision are particularly high
231,the hfeas critics believe that it sanctions designer babies and does not show respect for the sanctity of individual life
232,certainly the authoritys backing for shahana and raj hashmis plea for genetic screening raises fundamental questions about producing one human being to cure anothers disease
233,but the parents view is simple and compelling
234,the ivf treatment is available to help produce a baby whose tissue will match his or her elder brothers bone marrow
235,they require as mrs hashmi puts it a helping hand from the hfea
236,screening for genetic disorders has been permissible for some time
237,those who oppose the treatment on grounds that it echoes destructive eugenics programmes have misplaced their concern
238,the use of such techniques to weed out genes that might result in a disability does not suggest that disabled people are defective
239,it merely uses progress to prevent a malfunction of nature
240,they would not reject medical intervention to put right other things that go wrong with the body
241,yet they ask that mankind pass up the chance to use scientific advances in biotechnology to prevent unnecessary suffering
242,the inconsistency is striking and would be cruel if it were allowed to impede a beneficial solution
243,the hfea already backed tissuetype screening in principle in december
244,this latest move is a logical advance
245,we can welcome that and still accept the need to maintain the distinction between these and more frivolous or dubious reasons why parents might want to opt for genetic preselection
246,that is why it is also right that the hfea continues to reject genetic preselection if it helps parents choose gender let alone more superficial preferences for a certain appearance
247,grounds of pure preference are not enough to make parental choice paramount and the authority should resist pressure to give in on this point
248,the hashmis aim is very different
249,they are concerned with saving a life as well as creating one
250,they and their doctors may reject other embryos as imperfect matches but they are not selecting their baby as if it were a designer coat or handbag
251,this is a clear case of maximising benefits and minimising harm
252,the parents want another child and their existing son will be the beneficiary
253,critics of such technology warn that the child is to be used as a means rather than an end in itself
254,instead of being valued for his or her own sake they say the next hashmi babys raison dtre will be his lifesaving qualities
255,yet in wanting their child to serve a certain purpose this couple is merely following in the footsteps of countless couples before them couples who have wanted a child to boost their own relationship or provide their firstborn with a sibling
256,the hashmis decision is like that of any other couple who want the best for their child
257,shahana and raj hashmi will undoubtedly love their next baby as much as their first
258,as david beckham discovered to his cost the manager of manchester united likes to have the last word
259,which is why hes signed up for another years and 11m
260,one of the defining moments of sir alex fergusons glorious but often contentious career as manager of manchester united came in february when david beckham his star player failed to report for training
261,beckham said his baby son was ill and that he needed to be at home with him
262,fair enough
263,but when ferguson discovered that beckhams wife victoria was out shopping at the time he hit the roof
264,according to someone who knows him well the publicity machine that surrounds the beckhams has always been intensely irritating to him
265,now by his lights beckham was letting the side down and in fergusons book there is no greater sin
266,for the next match beckham was kicked out of the team
267,he wasnot even a substitute
268,it seemed unthinkable to drop beckham to put a personal squabble as some saw it before the interests of the team
269,but ferguson had done it
270,what the incident really betrayed was a clash of cultures a 21stcentury newman touchyfeeliness on the one hand and on the other the hard mans world that shaped ferguson growing up among the scottish working class in the 1950s
271,it certainly wasnot one in which wives have the definitive say in their husbands lives which is ironic in the light of what lay behind last weeks news that far from retiring at the end of this season as had previously been announced ferguson will remain at old trafford for another three years
272,though no great lover of the game fergusons wife cathy knew what it meant to him and could still mean and she perhaps didnot relish the prospect of having this great brooding figure about the house with no outlet for his footballing energies
273,no matter that he has achieved everything at united the european cup seven premier league titles four fa cups and one league cup or that he turned at the end of
274,cathy ferguson could see that there was plenty left in him and her intervention was crucial
275,why not carry on
276,as cathy says aretire when you feel tired ferguson said last week
277,and i feel strong young and fit
278,family has always been important to ferguson and so by extension have the wider roots of his upbringing
279,in his case that was govan the clydeside district on the southwestern edge of glasgow where his father alex snr was one of or so men who built ships
280,the sense of community in which ferguson grew up was palpable and as a young toolmaker in a glasgow factory he was soon involved in the union
281,fulltime professional football did not come until he was when he joined dunfermline
282,spells at three other clubs followed
283,he ran a pub in glasgow before taking up his first managerial post at st mirren
284,but it was as the manager of aberdeen from to that ferguson made his mark breaking the hold over scottish football enjoyed by rangers and celtic before moving to manchester
285,united was a club on which the past bore down
286,with both the munich air disaster of and the triumphs of the late 1960s it had a unique legacy that it was struggling to live up to
287,since the retirement in of the great sir matt busby a succession of managers had come and gone with little to show
288,would ferguson do any better
289,in the early years it was touch and go whether he would survive
290,but he bought some time by winning the fa cup in and the elusive championship the clubs first for years finally arrived in in the inaugural premier league season
291,since then united have been almost unstoppable as both a footballing and a commercial force
292,fergusons achievement has been to withstand the pressure that goes with running the worlds biggest club and at the same time maintain the attacking tradition of the united sides of old
293,even uniteds detractors the club is fiercely resented for its stranglehold on the english game have to admit that under ferguson domestic football has been raised to breathtaking new levels
294,if such erudite continentals as the england manager sven goran eriksson and arsne wenger of arsenal seem to represent a new studiousness in football then ferguson might be seen as a throwback to an age when the sort of men to whom he is heir tough fellowscots such as bill shankly and jock stein seethed with a passion for the game and exuded a sometimes terrifying authority
295,but you donot get to be the towering figure that ferguson has become without the shrewdness attention to detail and profound understanding of players personalities which no powers of intimidation can make up for
296,its just that unlike eriksson and wenger ferguson has been known to go into rages in which tables have been kicked and teacups thrown
297,theres a difference between oldstyle and oldfashioned says alastair campbell the downing street press chief who has welcomed ferguson as a staunch labour supporter
298,yes hes old style in that hes disciplined and he leads from the top
299,but what people perhaps donot understand about alex is that he has an incredibly acute intelligence
300,he was one of the first to appreciate the importance of diet and training regimes for players
301,at the same time he understands that united is a huge business
302,id say all that puts him in the new manager mould
303,few managers form bonds with players as ferguson does
304,he has regarded the welsh winger ryan giggs almost as a son ever since he broke into the team as a gifted 17yearold
305,in roy keane uniteds irresistible irish midfielder ferguson sees many of his own formidable qualities
306,and with eric cantona peter schmeichel and now the brilliant dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy ferguson has found his faith in individual genius with all its attendant pitfalls spectacularly rewarded
307,fergusons probably the last manager who can use fear as a weapon to deal with players says the sportswriter ken jones
308,thats very difficult today because the players have so much money that they can just turn round and tell you where to go
309,when loyalty to players is not returned ferguson does not easily forgive
310,likewise when he feels press criticism is unjustified
311,this season has seen a low point in his often turbulent relationship with reporters with ferguson cancelling press conferences and haranguing people when he does agree to turn up
312,one of fergusons three sons jason is also his agent and the questions raised about this arrangement have seriously rankled with him
313,does ferguson bear grudges
314,its more that he always has to have the last word says someone close to him
315,of course he has mellowed over the years
316,as the owner of some topclass horses he derives huge pleasure from racing often turning up on the gallops early in the morning after a match the night before
317,there was a time when he felt undervalued at united
318,what mattered to him about the big pay increase he secured a few years ago was not what it could buy him but what it said about his worth
319,at 11m over three years fergusons new contract makes him comfortably britains highest paid manager
320,by the crazy standards of the footballing economy it is money well spent
321,it is just a week since the independent on sunday launched its asthma campaign and already ministers have begun to take action
322,shrugging off their officials instinct to try to kick the issue into the long grass both michael meacher the environment minister and yvette cooper the public health minister have immediately appreciated its importance
323,both have referred the scientific studies revealed in this newspaper that indicate that traffic fumes can cause asthma to the official committee on the medical effects of air pollution
324,tomorrow mr meacher will press his european ministerial colleagues to impose tougher continentwide controls on ozone one of the main pollutants involved
325,and ms cooper is to send new guidance to doctors on tackling the growing epidemic of the disease in children
326,this is good as far as it goes and the ministers two of the best in a not overtalented government are to be commended for thinking out of the bureaucratic box
327,but it is only a small start and will take time to make a difference
328,the pollution committee does not meet until june
329,the new health guidelines will take two years to produce
330,and brussels notoriously moves at the pace of the snails so delectably served up in the citys restaurants
331,the urgency of the crisis blighting the lives of one in every seven british children and their families requires a much faster response
332,it also demands a more farreaching one
333,our report today that twothirds of british schools fail to help their asthmatic pupils and that hundreds of thousands of sufferers are not properly informed about their condition show how shamefully the departments of health and education have neglected the epidemic
334,meanwhile the department of transport at mr blairs specific backseat instruction is driving policy in the wrong direction towards more roads more cars more pollution and more asthma
335,the prime minister and the cabinet ministers in charge of the relevant departments must take on the issue themselves and institute wholesale changes in policy or take the blame for continuing child illness and death
336,the difference between dialup internet access and a highspeed service that is permanently on is akin to that between a horsedrawn cart and a car which is why there is usually no going back for people who have graduated from one to the other
337,so it would be churlish not to applaud the sharp price reduction announced yesterday by bt for its broadband service
338,assuming that the internet service providers pass on most of the cut an average monthly subscription should come down to around from the or so it currently costs
339,this is by any measure a swingeing cut and makes broadband service in britain as reasonably priced if not cheaper than its equivalent elsewhere in the world
340,whether it will be enough to persuade britons to sign up for the broadband arevolution with as much alacrity as americans or our fellow europeans however is another matter
341,germany already has million subscribers britain fewer than
342,the wonders of broadband are not at issue
343,the technology allows the same line to be used for internet access and telephone calls without either capability blocking the other
344,it enables audio and video files to be transferred almost instantaneously
345,whole films can be delivered in minutes
346,so why has britain been so comparatively slow to adopt the new technology
347,the widelyaccepted thesis is that high prices have are the main deterrent
348,certainly a month is steep and those cable companies that supply highspeed internet access have already attracted more subscribers than bt with monthly payments set at
349,but that is still double the price of many dialup subscriptions
350,and for home rather than professional use dialup access is adequate
351,the price cuts announced by bt mean that the theory of price as the chief obstacle to wider takeup will now be tested
352,in fact consumer resistance may lie elsewhere
353,even if the price of fast internet access is going down the price of computers remains static
354,and as with mobile phones there may be a limit to the range of services that people need or want from computers
355,if they are to conquer the mass market bt and the internet service providers must work harder to convince people that their most hitech services are not only competitively priced but relevant to their lives
356,decisions on the next phase of the unwisely named war against terrorism are creeping closer and most of the signs are that george bush will get them wrong
357,after he used his state of the union address to identify the equally unwisely named axis of evil the pressing question is what is to be done about iraq
358,that something ought to be done about iraq should not be in doubt
359,the question is whether the us is going to act against its enemies in a way that creates even more enemies
360,the next question is whether britain is going to support whatever president bush does regardless
361,saddam hussein is still a threat to his neighbours and potentially to the us and its allies
362,even if the direct risk to the west from his proven wish to acquire weapons of mass destruction is small the international community has a responsibility to act
363,as mr blair accepted yesterday there is not any evidence linking iraq with the terrorist attacks of september
364,the country must be treated as a problem in its own right and the issues remain much the same as they were before september last year
365,the main one is that of sanctions
366,to his credit mr blair seems to realise that the present sanctions regime plays into saddams hands allowing him to present the iraqi people as victims of brutal us imperialism
367,the british attempt at the united nations last year to lift sanctions on food and most trade foundered on objections by the russians to the definition of dualuse technology
368,but it is right to pursue a collective approach through the un where possible
369,the legitimacy of the aerial harassment of iraq over the past few years has been weakened by the fact that it has been a purely usbritish operation
370,the next phase of the campaign against various forms of international terrorism ought to be conducted through diplomacy renewing the global coalition about which mr bush seems to have forgotten already and working for treaties to restrain the proliferation of nuclear biological and chemical weapons
371,instead the president seems determined to pursue the short sighted and negative policy of asserting us might which will provoke resentment and breed more terrorism
372,mr blair should not be seduced by the collaborationist argument that he will have greater influence over us policy if he expresses doubts in private
373,he should say loud and clear that us policy is in danger of becoming counterproductive
374,trouble at bank
375,an abandoned flip chart in the foyer of a manchester branch of the halifax reveals an innovative policy unusual even in the creative world of finance they donot want customers
376,specifically they donot want new businesses businesses that deal in coinage taxidrivers windowcleaners markettraders and shopkeepers
377,napoleon would surely have approved
378,the company might protest that this disinclination is limited to a number of branches but we doubt it will wash
379,no business trades on image like a bank and the bank that likes to say no is splendidly irresistible
380,nevertheless there may well be those who would prefer to bank with a company that refused its facilities to say spin doctors prevaricating politicians most antipodean athletes particularly new zealand cricketers anyone associated with the department of transport interior designers on tv mike tyson or lady victoria hervey
381,we for our part however would like to stress and emphasise our intense delight in having you as a customer and look forward to renewing our most rewarding association tomorrow and for many years to come
382,thank you
383,taxi
384,the british have never been especially good at providing for their old age and the current mayhem in the pensions industry can only serve to make matters worse
385,for much of the second half of the last century this congenital failure to plan ahead didnot matter so much because of two saving graces now disappearing fast
386,the first was the state pension never generous often inadequate but never meanstested and always available to all
387,the second was the employerfunded final salary scheme for staff
388,most workers may not have even noticed that they were members of such schemes to which they often made no contribution of their own until that happy moment when they collected their gold watch and discovered that they would be on a guaranteed income of say twothirds of their final salary for the rest of their days irrespective of the vagaries of the stock market
389,now these two pillars are crumbling
390,the worth of the state pension was eroded after the thatcher government broke the link with average earnings
391,the abolition of serps state earningsrelated pension scheme shortly after also weakened the states provision
392,since labour came to power in we have seen a move towards meanstesting and the prospect of the basic pension withering on the vine
393,more seriously however we now see the move from final salary schemes turn into a stampede
394,the pensions watchdog opra says company schemes have been wound up and of the remaining at risk
395,prominent names such as abbey national ernst young marks spencer bt and j sainsbury have declared their schemes closed to newcomers
396,the supermarket group iceland is even disbanding its scheme for current members an extraordinary and morally questionable move
397,this abandonment of final salary schemes is often said by employers to be because of changes in accounting rules a red herring because the schemes are getting expensive true but probably not unmanageably so and because of the chancellor gordon browns stealth tax on pension funds
398,on this last point at least the companies are right
399,mr brown took 5bn a year out of the pensions system in the hope no one would notice a typically brownian attempt to pretend that public services can be paid for without pain
400,well we now know who will pay for mr browns tax the young the pensioners of tomorrow few of them rich
401,so without the state or our employers to look after us what are we to do
402,the answer to that was provided as long ago as when the then chancellor nigel lawson introduced personal pensions
403,they were meant to be a portable answer to the one big drawback with final salary schemes that few of us remained with one employer for our working lives
404,but the record has not been happy
405,high charges misleading claims and spectacular misselling have brought the industry into disrepute
406,the governments stakeholder scheme was an attempt to remedy these problems and to encourage the lower paid to take out pensions but it too has met with a lukewarm response
407,the outlook then is bleak
408,we are just such very poor savers now with new excuses about the untrustworthy nature of the financial services industry
409,the answer would seem to lie in the government providing a much more ambitious version of the stakeholder framework that would make private pensions a safer investment possibly linked to an element of compulsion
410,and we need to recognise that there will always be those who will never earn enough to secure an adequate income through a private scheme
411,for their sakes the state pension cannot be allowed to wither away
412,it seems that norman mailer has been uncharacteristically quiet about an event that occurred while he was in england on a chat tour
413,those interviewing the great man about the new mood of americans were told that we need our manhood reaffirmed every six seconds and this typically maileresque soundbite has a curious resonance in the case of jack henry abbott a convicted murderer who on february hung himself in his cell in a utah penitentiary
414,abbott it might just be remembered was briefly famous in when he was the hero then the villain of a dramatic tale of the literary life
415,a couple of years previously after hearing that norman mailer was working on a novel based on the life of the executed murderer gary gilmore abbott had written a series of letters from marion federal prison illinois about his own miserable life
416,from the age of onwards he had spent all his life apart from a year on the run in in an institution
417,behind bars he had descended into criminality and was currently serving a sentence for the fatal stabbing of a fellowinmate
418,the story that he told of childhood cruelty and neglect of woeful judicial prejudice of survival through violence in the unseen hell of the american penal system was probably not that unusual
419,the way that he wrote about it on the other hand was
420,this guy isnot a murderer hes an artist mailer proclaimed a trifle rashly under the circumstances
421,he collected the letters found a publisher for them and wrote an introduction for the book which was entitled in the belly of the beast
422,during the fuss surrounding publication he and other writers and actors began to campaign for abbotts release on parole
423,the book came out in and in the same year so did its author
424,briefly abbott became a semicelebrity in the literary scene
425,his work was serialised in the new york review of books
426,his ferocious uncompromising prose was acclaimed
427,the fact that he was walking free attending book launches and being interviewed on good morning america was seen as triumph of writerly solidarity a victory for literature over life
428,foreign rights in the book were sold worldwide including to britain where i an editor at the time was the proud publisher
429,then six weeks after abbotts release something unfortunate happened
430,while eating out at a manhattan restaurant the newly famous author became involved in an altercation with richard adan a young waiter an altercation that ended with adan being stabbed to death
431,the literary bandwagon came to a juddering halt
432,writers get excited when their quiet existence is enlivened by real events but that was too real
433,mailer susan sarandon and a few others attended abbotts trial but where there had been enthusiasm there was now embarrassment
434,those of us who had published the book found ourselves quietly burying it
435,after his excursion into the world of letters jack henry abbott resumed a life of obscurity
436,the incident became accepted as a perfect little parable of liberal naivety illustrating the dangers incurred by intellectuals who meddled in matters beyond their experience
437,opinions of abbotts talent were quietly revised with commentators inevitably quoting humbert humberts line from lolita you can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style
438,but perhaps now that abbott is dead it will be seen that there was more to his story than the gullibility of literary types that its real tragedy lies deep within american society
439,evil is the hot easy subject over there at the moment
440,anyone who wants to look beyond the labels and the namecalling could do worse than to read the letters sent from the belly of the beast by abbott
441,i have so far as i recall kept nude photographs of only one author
442,it happened during the 1990s when someone called elizabeth wurtzel was in england promoting her first book prozac nation
443,while being interviewed for a mens lifestyle magazine wurtzel decided to be more selfrevealing than is traditional on these occasions
444,when the photographer turned up she stripped off for a series of unscheduled candid shots
445,i found the results rather more interesting than most author profiles and for several weeks kept them among my papers for occasional reference
446,this confession mildly embarrassing as it may be is not in the same league as the kind of revelation on which elizabeth somehow i feel we are on firstname terms has built her career
447,in prozac nation she recounted selfdestructive adventures with cocaine men and therapy during her teens and twenties which had led to an addiction to prozac
448,the book was written in overheated but workmanlike prose and had she been a bloke or plain or middleaged it would hardly have been publishable
449,but elizabeth was a babe
450,she was prepared to dish intimate details about herself for journalists give photographers a few literary skin shots
451,the book became a bestseller and its author was described as the voice of generation
452,the ploy worked so well that elizabeth appeared cute as ever on the cover of her next book bitch in praise of difficult women
453,she was topless of course but as a small concession to seriousness her nipples had been airbrushed out elizabeth doesnot have any nipples her publisher told a reporter when the publicity wagon began to roll again
454,the content of bitch was consistent with its presentation
455,feminist writing has become dry
456,i want to make it wet again elizabeth announced
457,after drugs and sex where does a modern author go
458,back to more drugs and sex of course
459,this week a new work from elizabeth wurtzel is in the bookshops recounting her latest addiction this time to ritalin the drug given to hyperactive children
460,the thought heartless but irresistible occurs that professionally this was a neat career move conforming perfectly to what a publisher wants from an author the same formula as before but slightly different
461,what is interesting about elizabeths progress is precisely that her version of emotional porn the hysterical yet glamorising exploitation of ones own darker secrets is so sensationally successful
462,to judge by a lengthy newspaper extract the new book more now again is no better written than a promising adolescents diary yet its author has been reviewed in time magazine and interviewed on cnn while her book has been serialised in an allegedly serious british broadsheet
463,a brief visit to one of the numerous websites devoted to her life and works reveals where her appeal lies
464,a fan heather writes that each large paragraph i devour gets me one leap closer to being me
465,another message headed a cry for help is from jeanette i donot know why i cry canot sleep or concentrate but iam getting tired
466,slowly iam dying but iam still trying at to find happiness
467,this surely is a profitable new publishing genre in the making
468,if heather and jeanette are pretty and ambitious they too might one day turn their intimate secrets into literary gold
469,if as seems more likely they are neither of these things they will at least have the dubious reassurance that addiction is sexy that confession pushed far enough could make you the voice of a generation
470,meanwhile my former pinup is offering her views on virtually anything
471,in manhattan during the attack on the world trade centre she later revealed that she felt not the slightest emotional reaction
472,i thought this is a really strange arts project
473,those following her career may form the same conclusion
474,barrister war hero politician
475,officially murdered by irish national liberation army march
476,unofficially a spy who knew too much
477,unanswered questions was he involved in dirty tricks and extreme rightwing conspiracies
478,why did he have to die
479,and is the story about to be revealed
480,as far away as trafalgar square officeworkers felt the shudder
481,what was that
482,was the question repeated across central london
483,up on the fifth floor of the ministry of defence halfway down whitehall someone instantly articulated the answer
484,its a bomb the secretaries were told in quiet chill tones
485,it was march and the dull boom was the sound of what was perhaps the most audacious attack ever mounted on the heart of the british political establishment in modern times
486,the bomb planted by an ira splinter group had exploded in the underground car park inside the house of commons
487,a mercury tiltswitch had been activated in the car of the tory politician airey neave as he drove up the exit ramp
488,why neave
489,he appeared to be a figure of small consequence
490,he had last had a post in government in when he was a junior minister in the transport department
491,in his current position as opposition spokesmen on northern ireland he might have seemed no more a target than the score of other british politicians who had held such a post in recent times
492,in fact the life that was brought to an end so violently that day was one of the most enigmatic in modern politics
493,for airey neave existed in a shadowy world that shifted constantly between the glare of public life and the furtive secrecy of the british intelligence services
494,he was a man indeed who might be said to have not just a double life but a triple one
495,next month a new biography of the murdered man public servant secret agent by the political journalist paul routledge is published
496,it describes neave as the ghost in the establishment faceless and featureless quietly and decisively fixing the course of events
497,but will it unravel the real mystery at the heart of the man
498,airey neave was first thrust into the public eye during the second world war when in he became the first british soldier to escape from the german prisonerofwar camp in the infamous colditz castle which nazi propaganda had proclaimed to be escapeproof
499,it was a schoolboy tale of derringdo in which the eton and oxfordeducated officer who had already been mentioned in dispatches and awarded the military cross for bravery on the battlefield teamed up with a dutch officer to stage a daring escape
500,dressed in clothes painted to look like german officers uniforms with cardboard badges they wandered into the castle guardroom and then with the dutch officer chatting in fluent german sauntered past the guards whom they ordered to stand to attention and out of the gate to freedom
501,from there they made their way through neutral switzerland and thence through vichy france to spain gibraltar and safety in a feat that played directly to the cherished wartime stereotype of jaunty british pluck
502,after the war newlyqualified as a barrister neave was assigned to the british war crimes team at nuremberg where he served the indictments on goering and the other major nazi war criminals
503,thereafter he moved into politics and by had become conservative mp for the staunch home counties seat of abingdon
504,warhero lawyer politician ltcol airey neave was by the age of already a man of many parts
505,yet that was not all
506,on his return to britain after escaping from colditz he was on the strength of his experience recruited by military intelligence to a division of mi6 known as mi9 which advised on escape and insurrection in occupied europe until the end of the war
507,neave took part in clandestine operations behind enemy lines helping other pows to escape
508,so outraged was hitler by his activities that neaves london flat was put on hitlers target list
509,officially he remained in intelligence until
510,unofficially he never left continuing to be involved in mi6 as was his wife diana through her links with the migr polish community
511,ironically the couple did not at the time of their marriage know about the others secret life
512,they found out by chance
513,one night i lost one of my agents diana revealed many years later and he was one of aireys too so it all came out over dinner
514,neave was never to lose his taste for covert manoeuvring which proved a morethanuseful asset in the world of politics
515,in the 1950s he had a solid but unremarkable career as a junior minister in the colonial and aviation ministries before falling from favour
516,he had stood down from his job because of illness but when he returned in good health and asked for a new job the then chief whip edward heath told the rightwinger youare finished
517,for years neave nursed his bitterness and when in a challenge was raised to heath as leader of the conservative party neave became campaign manager for the rightist contender margaret thatcher
518,in a tactical masterstroke neave encouraged many backbenchers to think that thatcher stood little chance of victory
519,he hinted that mps who were not themselves on the right of the party but still felt it was time for heath to go should vote thatcher in the first ballot thus forcing heaths resignation and allowing other more likely candidates such as willie whitelaw to enter the race
520,yet in the event thatcher performed so well in the first ballot that she beat heath her candidacy gaining so much momentum that none of her rivals could catch her
521,she won and neave became the leader of her private office where his influence and according to the diaries of the former tory minister alan clark his subtlety and insight were such that mrs thatcher said that she had been left feeling like a puppet whose strings have been cut
522,but neaves manipulations were not restricted to the political arena
523,though the iron lady when she became leader of the opposition offered him the chance to shadow any cabinet post he wanted and take on the same job when the tories came to power he chose to forgo the great offices of state and asked for northern ireland
524,this meant that in an era when ireland was replacing the cold war as the chief preoccupation of military intelligence the security services had one of their men in a pivotal role at a crucial moment in the history of the province
525,quite what neaves role in the secret service was in the years that followed has never become clear
526,critics of british policy in ulster maintained that british intelligence became involved in treasonable policies
527,in the labour mp ken livingstone used the cover of parliamentary privilege to suggest in the house of commons that airey neave was a co conspirator with mi5 and mi6 in disinformation activities involving the controversial whistleblowing spies colin wallace and peter wright
528,he also alleged that a week before his murder neave sought to recruit a former mi6 officer to set up a small group to involve itself in the internal struggles of the labour party
529,livingstones efforts earned him a deluge of condemnation from the british establishment but there were straws in the wind that induced several security experts to wonder whether something untoward had indeed occurred
530,these were not the wildest allegations
531,there were improbable tales about how neave and others had a decade earlier planned to set up an army of resistance to the labour government of the wilson era to forestall a communist takeover and talked of assassinating tony benn should he become prime minister
532,yet such was the febrile atmosphere of that cold war epoch that some sceptics gave credibility to the possibility
533,this was it must be remembered the time about when auberon waugh fed by various sources including his mi6 agent uncle auberon herbert produced a series of clearly defamatory articles in private eye openly alleging that the former prime minister harold wilson was a kgb agent
534,even as late as when mrs thatcher became leader of the conservative party groups of senior tories were secretly gathering to hear spywriters such as chapman pincher address them on the grave dangers facing britain from the left
535,it was in response to such beliefs according to claims by the antifascist magazine searchlight that plans for secret armed cells to resist a more leftwing labour government were drawn up by a group that included george kennedy young the exdeputy director of the british intelligence service mi6 and a notorious racist and antisemite and airey neave
536,the claim gained unexpected credence when despite official mod denials two former british army generals sir anthony farrarhockley the former nato commander of allied forces northern europe and general sir walter walker another former head of natos forces confirmed that a secret armed network of selected civilians was set up in britain after the war and was secretly modernised in the thatcher years and maintained into the 1980s
537,moreover searchlight alleged neave and young were key figures in an extreme right group called tory action which was at the centre of a smear campaign involving the secret services aimed at discrediting the labour government in britain in
538,yet whatever fire burned behind the smoke of such talk what was beyond dispute was that the paramilitaries of the ira and its splinter group the irish national liberation army inla which planted the fateful bomb under airey neaves car saw in margaret thatchers minence grise an opponent of such significance that he had to be taken out
539,the inla made up of members of the official ira who defected after its ceasefire and provos who resented their leaders cessation of violence in justified neaves assassination because they said he engaged in rabid militarist calls for more repression against the irish people
540,but it was more than rhetoric they feared
541,they saw in airey neave the architect of a new hardline british policy on northern ireland which would place an increased emphasis on a militarist approach to the political problem
542,in the months after his death that hardening came about though many commentators would see it not as a preordained strategy but a response to increased republican terror
543,not long after neaves assassination the queens uncle lord mountbatten of burma was killed when a terrorist bomb blasted apart his fishing boat and on the same day soldiers died in a provo bombblast at warrenpoint in the worst singleday ulster death toll for a decade
544,perhaps it was small wonder that when republican prisoners in the maze prison demanding special category status went on hunger strike margaret thatcher decided to let them die
545,in all this was airey neave the cause or just the casualty
546,her mentors death may have strengthened the resolve of margaret thatcher not to make any concessions to the ira but it seems clear that in the new tory government was firmly set in a thoughtthrough policy on how to deal with militant republicanism
547,the evidence for this is all there in the earlier statements of airey neave himself most pointedly in his call two years earlier for sinn fein to be proscribed as a political party
548,by this neave disdainfully sought to undermine the republican movements dual strategy of engagement in the democratic process backed up by acts of violence
549,deprived of the ballot the ira would have nowhere left to go but back to the bullet leaving the british authorities with a much stronger tactical argument against the paramilitaries
550,there is no such thing as political murder political bombing or political violence as mrs thatcher was later to put it articulating the philosophy of airey neave
551,there is only criminal murder criminal bombing and criminal violence
552,we will not compromise on this
553,was there a similar resolution about airey neaves contempt for those in the labour party whom tory paranoia in the seventies deemed to be about to paint englands green and pleasant land a shade of soviet red
554,it may now have seeped from the common political memory but there was in those days talk of private armies being formed as a deterrent to any potential political strike
555,it was not long after edward heaths conservative government fell in the aftermath of its three day week confrontation with the miners during their strike
556,field marshall lord carver a former head of the british armed forces later revealed that fairly senior officers at the armys headquarters had discussed military intervention during the miners strike in
557,and when the labour party under harold wilson was returned to power that year if alarm bells did not ring loudly behind the closed doors of the intelligence agencies they certainly did in the political circles in which neave moved
558,one of his contacts general sir walter walker a man who opined there was a communist cell right there in the middle of downing street formed a group called civil assistance which later transformed itself into a selfproclaimed private army that called itself unison and that claimed to have the support of senior serving and retired british forces chiefs
559,another the former sas leader david stirling set up an organisation called greater britain gb75 whose members included a jerseybased arms dealer
560,stirling who was described by his biographer as well to the right of the conservative party considered the left wing of the labour party as a cancer
561,his fear summed up in one of his papers for gb75 was expressed thus why are so many of us blind to an already far advanced conspiracy by the broad left to topple our democracy
562,it is now the broad left which harbours the baddies and which is devoted to creating a privileged class of rulers hell bent on demolishing our individual rights and on creating a totally socialistic and therefore totalitarian state
563,the near takeover of the labour party by its parliamentary leftwing activists in alliance with the trade union extremists poses the most menacing crisis our country has ever faced more dangerous by far than the worst period of the last world war
564,this crisis cannot possibly be resolved within parliament alone
565,it all sounds so preposterous now
566,but at the time men like airey neave war hero barrister politician and secret agent seemed to believe it
567,just how far he was prepared to act on his farfetched analysis we may despite the best efforts of paul routledges forthcoming biography never know
568,at any rate the murderous men of violence of the irish republican movement decided that they did not need to wait for proof
569,ive just had to change hotels five times in five days
570,why did i bother with five sets of clothes
571,i saw everyone only once
572,always take clothes that are at the end of their life then you can have the pleasure of throwing them away at the end of your trip
573,using my bath washing technique youll soon have that case down to carryon size
574,if you believe their critics our noble lords have proved themselves supreme lords of spin
575,yesterdays report on cloning from the lords select committee on stemcell research gives the thumbsup to a technique that it says offers areal and great hope for a range of common diseases
576,yet this was the only possible outcome because it was a putup job according to the antiabortion lobby which says the committee was packed with clonings supporters
577,the conclusion is indeed unsurprising but for a different reason it reflects the overwhelming weight of current medical and scientific opinion
578,the cloning issue has been more thoroughly aired examined and debated than any other in science and medicine in recent years
579,official reports have been published by the human genetics advisory commission the human fertilisation and embryology authority hfea and the chief medical officer
580,all have backed cloning for stem cells the bodys master cells from cloned embryos or cloned adult cells to produce new tissues for body repair
581,the courts too have had their say
582,the prolife alliance claimed in a case last year that there was nothing in british law to stop scientists from trying to create cloned human beings in the laboratory because the only kind of reproduction controlled under the human fertilisation and embryology act was that involving the union of sperm and egg which is not required in cloning
583,the judge agreed and an embarrassed government was forced to rush through legislation expressly banning reproductive cloning
584,yesterdays decision by the house of lords select committee adds little to the debate beyond endorsing the existing legislation
585,by coincidence the hfea was yesterday considering the first applications for licences to conduct embryonic stemcell research for therapeutic purposes
586,the coincidence is interesting and the consensus of opinion is clear there is much to hope for and now that obvious loopholes have been closed little to fear from therapeutic cloning
587,the uks regulatory framework is among the most sophisticated in the world and has helped us to avoid the chaotic situation in the us where the technique is banned in federally funded laboratories but permitted in the private sector
588,scientists should be given the goahead
589,enough talk let the research begin
590,the ceasefire in sri lanka is a ray of unexpected optimism
591,the 19yearlong war between the sri lankan government and the tamil tiger guerillas has been parked in the file marked insoluble conflicts for as long as most people can remember
592,some of the salient features of this civil war may have stuck in the mind
593,the tigers reputation as one of the worlds most ruthless and single minded terrorist organisations
594,their use of cyanide pills to ensure their members were not taken alive
595,their early use of suicide bombing including the assassination of rajiv gandhi the indian prime minister in
596,the repeated failure of attempts to negotiate punctuated by the murder and attempted murder of sri lankan politicians
597,for the past few years however this has been a forgotten war
598,most of the worlds media this newspaper included were caught out by the success of yesterdays ceasefire agreement brokered in norway
599,for all the inevitable cautions this is a moment for rejoicing
600,it is only a ceasefire with the substantive negotiations yet to take place but it is permanent and it includes provisions to protect civilians from the tamil tigers extortion rackets and press gangs
601,if it can be done in sri lanka it can be done anywhere
602,it is too much to hope that ariel sharon will recognise the implications of yesterdays announcement in oslo for his slide into war with palestinian guerillas
603,he prefers to draw a false analogy with the response of the united states to a form of terrorism which while superficially similar to that of the tamil tigers and hamas is in fact quite different
604,the conflicts in sri lanka and israelpalestine are essentially between ethnic groups and over territory the motivation of alqaida is apocalyptic religiosity
605,as in northern ireland as in sri lanka as in the middle east the only way to achieve a lasting peace is by negotiation and compromise
606,the experience of northern ireland as well as the fate of the middle east peace deal signed in oslo in suggests that there still is a long way to go in sri lanka
607,however for now the new sri lankan prime minister ranil wickremasinghe and the norwegian government which takes its responsibility for the cause of world peace remarkably seriously deserve the warmest congratulations
608,there was fiction by h e bates and poetry by cesare pavese
609,renatus hartogs md phd discussed the psychology of hoarding
610,richard burton and elizabeth taylor talked about their stormy marriage
611,derek malcolm reviewed a new film called a clockwork orange
612,eugene schoenfeld md revealed that the principal cause of male insecurity was the fear that their penises are not large enough
613,there was a special offer of a bikini for
614,and a doublepage advert declared that crimplene was the fabric to capture the mood of spring
615,from its very first issue the march issue which went on sale years ago this month cosmopolitan confounded expectations
616,it mixed high art and popular culture and covered diverse subjects from kissing to getting bank loans if you were a single woman that had not previously been found within the same covers
617,the launch editor joyce hopkirk appealed directly to readers you are that cosmopolitan girl arenot you
618,and explained who her target audience was
619,youare very interested in men naturally but think too much of yourself to live your life entirely through him
620,that means youare going to make the most of yourself your body your face your clothes your hair your job and your mind
621,if brains came last on hopkirks list her readers did not seem to care
622,the first issue sold out its print run of copies by lunchtime the second was an even bigger success selling
623,cosmo as its readers immediately began to call it had enjoyed one of the most successful launches in magazine history
624,it became synonymous with the freedom women were enjoying or trying to enjoy as a consequence of the sexual revolution
625,i was one of those original readers
626,i loved cosmo devouring it with the same enthusiasm i felt for the female eunuch which had been published only two years earlier
627,i was a teenage reader of cicero and jackie t s eliot and georgette heyer so i wasnot at all discomfited to find nobelprize winning novelists and male pinups in the same magazine
628,hopkirk engagingly introduced a short story by alberto moravia by observing that our fiction is a bit tough
629,but then isnot life
630,the second issue introduced pictures of naked men under the notquiteaccurate coverline our first male pinup reveals all
631,paul du feu who had been married to germaine greer was photographed lounging on the floor his right leg modestly raised to conceal his genitals
632,by the late 1970s when i was working on a local paper in the north of england and pining for london i used to hang around newsagents waiting for the next issue to come in
633,youare too cosmopolitan for us a colleague once observed sadly and i took it as the most enormous compliment
634,some of my friends can still recall individual articles from that period
635,how many magazines can you say that about
636,one of them wondered last week when we were reminiscing about the early days of cosmo
637,it wasnot the advice on sex she remembered but articles on finance and property which inspired her to do her own conveyancing when she bought her first house
638,i remember the thrill of acquiring my first bottle of areal perfume a tiny phial of diorella through one of its special offers
639,several years later i plucked up courage to leave my then boyfriend with whom i had lived since leaving university after reading an article in cosmo on breaking up
640,there were pioneering features on abortion which had been legalised in this country five years before the magazine appeared on newsagents shelves the third issue of cosmo explained why the new law wasnot working
641,hopkirk took the extraordinary step of flagging it up on the cover naming four famous women who had had terminations
642,it is this noholdsbarred approach to sex and its consequences that many people still associate with the original cosmo
643,early issues offered ways to kiss a man so that hes yours for life or long enough and things to say in bed
644,ten years later when hopkirk had been succeeded as editor by deidre mcsharry the magazine was maintaining its image with raunchy coverlines
645,but it also had jill tweedie on women money and the freedom to love confirming the magazines commitment both to good writing and the goal of financial independence for its readers
646,the january issue offered to take the fear out of fellatio in which the splendidly named avodah k offit md assured readers that oral sex arequires only the most fundamental intelligence to comprehend or accomplish
647,it may not have sounded much fun but she told them exactly how to do it
648,these days the sexual boundaries have been pushed much further the february edition of the magazine issue contains bondage tips for beginners tie your legs with stockings not rope for example and sex diaries written by cosmo readers
649,yet the original cosmo message was never quite as libertarian as it now seems
650,it flirted with the establishment so that jilly coopers guide to men she imagined would make good lovers included this extraordinary statement on the one hand i fancy robert maxwell because he seems to be so nasty on the other i adore geoffrey johnsonsmith because hes so nice and think of the kudos of being the undersecretary of state for defence
651,its hard to imagine todays twentysomething cosmo readers being able to name a junior defence minister in tony blairs government let alone having sexual fantasies about him
652,hopkirk herself in what would now be called her mission statement revealed a divorce and her share of emotional hangups
653,cosmo girls were she thought prone to aggravations like jealousy envy and a feeling of just not being up to it that hits us all too often
654,in that sense the magazine was not so much moulding its readers as identifying with them and sending out mixed messages as a result
655,the first issue included the confessions of a sleeparound girl and denied that there was anything glamorous about promiscuity
656,if you chip away at the faade you usually find a miserable victim of shattered emotions it warned frantically seeking shreds of affection from man after man
657,the second characterised paul du feu as mellors to greers lady chatterley describing him as an easygoing labourer who is totally disinterested sic in womens lib or any other political cause
658,another sign that the magazine was not totally at ease with sex was its reliance on american sexologists
659,you donot need to be medically qualified to explain the female orgasm or how to do fellatio but cosmos contributors tended to have strings of letters after their names and jobs at american universities
660,this may have reflected the fact that cosmo was originally an american magazine founded by the formidable helen gurley brown author of sex and the single girl
661,but it also suggests a need to lend professional respectability to what would otherwise have remained taboo subjects
662,it may also have reflected the confusion many of its readers were feeling
663,while the sixties is fixed in everyones mind as a revolutionary decade some of its most longreaching effects only made themselves felt later
664,this is particularly true of feminism which got going in the seventies and was in many ways a reaction to the maleness of the sexual revolution
665,cosmo arrived at a moment when the word girl was already going out of fashion soon to be used only by male chauvinists or with irony by women themselves the magazine was both ahead and behind the times and had a tendency to preach to its readers
666,but it treated them as people with the same breadth of interests and ambitions as men
667,it assumed they could cope with highbrow fiction and pages of type without the endless crossheads photographs and pullout quotes that are a feature of todays magazines
668,it quickly lost its ambivalence about feminism telling readers about the polish trade union movement solidarity and bemoaning its neglect of women
669,the author of a piece about solidarity lynne jones was billed as a doctor and a feminist
670,i wrote for it occasionally myself on subjects as varied as ian mcewans fiction and the return of the corset as a fashion item
671,i donot remember precisely when i stopped buying it but there was a time in the eighties when i began to feel that cosmo contained the same articles as all the other womens magazines
672,it had lost its capacity to surprise and there were new titles with a different agenda like marie claire that i liked better
673,what seems extraordinary in retrospect is how long it remained faithful to the original concept
674,by the beginning of the 1990s adverts for cosmetic surgery had begun to appear and the layout was changing to look like other magazines
675,these days it is more obviously youthoriented and displays the same obsession with bubblegum celebrities backstage with britney as its competitors
676,it is a successful formula currently selling copies but something has inevitably been lost
677,todays cosmo is coarser and less critical confessional rather than analytical and nervous about challenging preconceptions
678,threequarters of the magazines readers would like cosmetic surgery according to the latest issue which offers photos of readers who have gone under the knife theyare pleased with the results you be the judge
679,of course hopkirks cosmopolitan was a product of its time and couldnot stay the same
680,the demise of nova a stylish sixties title that was recently revived then closed demonstrates how the womens magazine market has changed
681,but what is so striking about the original cosmo years on is how innovative and intelligent it was
682,it encouraged its readers to be brave to experiment in every area of their lives and sympathised with their dilemmas
683,it may have addressed its readers as girls but it was definitely a magazine for grownups
684,i thought id reached paradise an empty beach half an hour from the nearest petrol station and small shop carfree dirt roads and locally grown fruit and vegetables
685,a sign said killing hens and perching pullets
686,perhaps you have to kill your freerange dinner yourself
687,i didnot bother to find out
688,at the store my big mistake was to buy the local newspaper which informed me that michael barrymore arrives in new zealand any day now and plans to visit a local drink and drugabuse centre
689,new zealand is a nuclearfree zone
690,and theyve disbanded their air force
691,is it too much to ask that they introduce a rigorous new form of vetting at immigration
692,anyone whos sold their story to a british tabloid should be refused entry
693,then the country would really be pollutantfree
694,the case of ms susan wallace who went down to her local with igwig the iguana has lessons for us all that go well beyond the blindingly obvious do not take your iguana to the pub
695,ms wallace you may recall has just ended up with a conviction for assault and unnecessary suffering and not to the iguana
696,lesson one is that even half a pint of lager the amount ms wallace was reported to have drunk has peculiar effects when combined with the presence of a rather large lizard sprawled across your back
697,lesson two which is not altogether discouraging is that men in pubs have a problem with rather large lizards sprawled across ladies backs perceiving them as a threat
698,precisely what the men found so threatening about the lizard was not actually disclosed in court
699,was it his claws his tongue his colour his reptilian mien the mysterious smile on his face or perhaps his female companion
700,which brings us to lesson three
701,when out alone in the evening you can leave the mace the pepper spray and the rape alarm safely at home
702,just donot forget the iguana and steer clear of pubs
703,poor david warner
704,one of the finest actors of his generation he returned to the west end last week after an absence of three decades induced by stage fright
705,his return is to be shortlived after a torrent of terrible reviews and subsequent tiny audiences the producers pulled the plug on a feast of snails in which he was performing
706,mr warners experience is the downside of some very good news
707,it has always been said that no one lost money underestimating the lowest common denominator of the publics appetite
708,that is no doubt still true but after years in which the west end was dominated by musicals or lowbrow revues london is enjoying a revival of the serious play
709,even better most of them are new
710,audiences are knocking each other over to book tickets for the likes of humble boy the lieutenant of inishmore and gagarin way
711,producers used to say there was no point in experimenting with new work because there was no audience for it in commercial theatre
712,that is now clearly wrong
713,but for every success there will always be failures
714,mr warner was unfortunate to be in one of them
715,better luck next time mr warner
716,one of the joys of modern olympic games is the discovery that yet another unlikely activity impossible to judge objectively uninteresting to watch or mechanised to the point of absurdity is in fact an official medalentitling sport
717,to synchronised swimming and icedancing we now add the freestyle mle for teenagers in search of a drink the rubberbullet shooting at moving targets and of course competitive pharmacology in which participants try to establish if given substances are covered by the ban on epo
718,little wonder the television audience in this country in any case has been so attracted to the snookerlike qualities of the peaceful wholesome sport of brushing ice backwards with a broom
719,no drugs or violence there but it is a little disillusioning to discover that the scottish gold medallists who captured hearts and headlines were helped in their sweeping and stonesliding technique by computer analysis at the centre for materials science and engineering at the university of edinburgh
720,it seems the tradition of sporting amateurism is safer in the hands of the youngsters trying to storm the budweiser tent
721,the rules of war which americas war crimes envoy yesterday declared obsolete have evolved over a century and a half in which the nature of warfare has moved from pitched battles to the horrors of international terrorism
722,the first guidelines were drawn up in and revised over the years
723,the conventions remain the most important international instruments for defending human dignity in war
724,they provide the legal foundation for the work of the red cross and have been signed by almost countries
725,these are the rules that president george bushs envoy pierrerichard prosper now suggests are out of date as the us administration tries to deal with the aftermath of the international outrage which followed its refusal to allow taliban and alqaida detainees the conventions protection at guantanamo bay
726,in the summer of henri dunant a sometime diarist and sometime merchant was travelling in northern italy when he arrived in the small village of castiglione delta pieve
727,dunant could not have arrived at a more inauspicious time
728,that day june a battle was raging around castiglione in what would be a decisive episode in the struggle for italian unification
729,the french allied to the sardinians and with emperor napoleon iii at their head faced the austrian troops men in all engaged in a bitter and unrelenting battle
730,by the end of the day when the austrians abandoned their positions more than men would be dead and wounded in what was known as the battle of solferino
731,though initially an unintentional observer dunant played an important role that day chronicling the battle and the efforts afterwards by local people to treat the dying and wounded regardless of their allegiance
732,working from the church of castiglione the chiesa maggiore dunant helped local woman as they did what they could with only the most basic of materials
733,the effect of this young man from a privileged background was so great that it led him to organise an international convention that eventually developed into guidelines for all countries involved in combat
734,in a memory of solferino published in dunant wrote i was a mere tourist with no part whatever in this great conflict but it was my rare privilege through an unusual train of circumstances to witness the moving scenes that i have resolved to describe
735,here is a hand tohand struggle in all its horror and frightfulness austrians and allies trampling each other underfoot killing one another on piles of bleeding corpses felling their enemies with their riflebutts crushing skulls ripping bellies open with sabre and bayonet
736,no quarter is given it is a sheer butchery a struggle between savage beasts maddened with blood and fury
737,even the wounded fight to the last gasp
738,when they have no weapon left they seize their enemies by the throat and tear them with their teeth
739,dunant wrote of the efforts to help the wounded every family was bent on having french wounded under its roof and no effort was spared to console the men for finding themselves far from their country their families and their friends
740,the best doctors gave them their care in private houses as well as in hospitals
741,dunant helped form the international committee for relief to the wounded which later became the international committee of the red cross
742,in response to an invitation from the international committee representatives from countries and four philanthropic institutions gathered in geneva and agreed on a basic code to ensure the protection of medical services on the battlefield
743,this became known as the geneva convention for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded in armies in the field
744,it contained articles
745,later conferences extended the basic law to other categories of victims such as prisoners of war
746,in in the hague a second convention was signed extending the principles to warfare at sea
747,in and again in there were further extensions
748,in the aftermath of the second world war another meeting in dealt with civilians and prisoners of war
749,these last two conventions are perhaps the most important
750,conventions iii and iv offer wideranging protection for civilians and enemy forces taken prisoner
751,these can include amembers of militia or volunteer corps they say
752,they add persons taking no part in the hostilities shall in all circumstances be treated humanely
753,the conventions say that passing of sentences without previous judgment from a regularly constituted court is prohibited and that the wounded and the sick shall be cared for
754,they add pows shall enjoy complete latitude in the exercise of their religious duties
755,henri dunant could not have known that his actions more than years ago would have resulted in such a legacy
756,it is this legacy that mr bushs representative mr prosper is trying to change
757,a tempting inference could be drawn from recent events tony blair and his advisers may be losing their touch
758,by no means deficient in intellect they have been supremely good at manipulation and their cunning has never been inhibited by addiction to the truth
759,in the past however they have known when to lie what they could get away with
760,but their judgement now seems to have deserted them
761,in his handling of the mittal affair mr blair has made two elementary mistakes
762,he forgot that the coverup can be more damaging than the original offence
763,he also forgot that politicians should avoid situations in which their conduct can only have two explanations that they are fools or knaves
764,yet this is where mr blair now finds himself
765,when the mittal story broke mr blair and alastair campbell were instantly aware of its potential for embarrassment
766,yet they have often spun their way out of worse messes and this time they had luck on their side
767,the story would be competing for coverage with princess margarets funeral
768,not only that they had a plausible defence
769,romania is trying to modernise its economy mr blair could have claimed so it is desirable to bring in foreign expertise and capital to privatise and modernise an outdated steel industry
770,britain may not have had a direct interest but it is clearly to britains advantage that everything should be done to bring stability and economic progress to eastern europe
771,mr blair might have gone on as for mr mittal he may not be a british subject but he is a friend of this country
772,he is also a highly successful entrepreneur
773,if the government helps him to help the rumanians he might decide to invest more in the uk
774,the tories seem to be saying that we should not do business with mr mittal
775,is this because they are racist or because they hate successful businessmen
776,they have questioned mr mittals donations to the labour party but he did so because he believes in a british government that believes in business
777,to suggest that he was trying to buy favours is beneath contempt
778,this would not have been a perfect defence
779,the juxtaposition between electoral assistance and ambassadorial assistance would still have left a smell of drains intensified by peter mandelsons success in bringing the hindujas back to the political agenda
780,he will receive no gratitude for that from no
781,but the blair government could have provided itself with a plausible story which would also have made it easier to explain the european bank for reconstruction and developments decision to subsidise mr mittal
782,the government could then have argued that the ebrd shared its assessment
783,now however the news that the british ambassadors helpful letter was reinforced by a 6m douceur will appear like the next installment in a tale of corruption
784,during his rise to great wealth mr mittal must have brought off many financial coups
785,but did he ever manage to achieve such a rapid 48fold increase in the value of an investment as when he gave to the labour party and received 6m from the british taxpayer
786,the fault does not lie with mr mittal
787,he is just a hopeful hustling billionaire
788,it lies with mr blairs claims that his mittal steel was a british company
789,unless the pm was a fool he must have known that this claim was unsustainable
790,mr blair is not a fool that defence is not open to him
791,when he insisted that mittal is a british company he must have known that he was lying
792,so what led him not only to lie but to lie in such a feeble and selfdestructive fashion
793,a simple explanation would be a combination of arrogance and navet
794,power has gone to mr blairs head
795,a combination of apparently unlimited electoral puissance and an underlying lack of both intellectual selfconfidence and political principle has destabilised him
796,mr blair has never been much good at explaining his beliefs he no long sees why he should even have to try
797,recently as was demonstrated over the wreckers speech on public services his response to the rough probing and disrespect which are inescapable in democratic politics was a loss of temper
798,he no longer accepts the requirement to submit himself to any questioning whatsoever
799,yet once a premier ceases to respect his questioners he also ceases to respect his voters
800,the one set of persons to whom mr blair is if anything more respectful is the rich
801,few prime ministers have ever taken office understanding so little of the british governmental process as mr blair did or thinking less of it
802,he knew that a lot was wrong with the public sector but he did not know how to put that right
803,but he had learnt an important lesson from the thatcher years when british business so long depressed and disordered had sprung ahead and recovered its status in world markets
804,from the outset he was convinced that the answer to any problem he encountered in government was to bring in a businessman to solve it for him
805,that is a simplistic view
806,not all parts of the public service are susceptible to the business approach
807,businessmen are there to make a profit yet governments have to provide services to people from whom no profit could ever be expected
808,the ethos of business is commercial
809,to paraphrase calvin coolidge the business of business is business
810,yet the activities of government cannot all be reduced to commercial imperatives
811,there is an inescapable dimension of public service and of politics
812,but as mr blair demonstrated over his handling of the rose addis case he does not believe that the public is entitled to complain about the services it receives
813,he is also impatient about politics
814,if he ever did he no longer believes that the answer to political questions lies in the rough and tumble of debate
815,he believes that he is entitled to call in the disinterested expertise of businessmen and that when he has done so all debate should cease
816,this will not work
817,most voters understand business better than mr blair does
818,above all they understand that businessmen have business interests
819,the voters have no objections to this as long as those businessmen do not try to promote their interests by exercising undue influence over government
820,but it will be hard for mr blair to persuade the voters that his business friends do not have access to undue influence
821,few public reputations now stand lower than neil hamiltons
822,yet when mr hamilton became a minister he wrote to mohammed fayed and told him that he could no longer involve himself with any aspect of mr fayeds affairs
823,as a result mr fayed turned on him and destroyed him
824,if mr hamilton had written letters on mr fayeds behalf similar to the one tony blair wrote on mr mittals behalf mr hamilton would not now be a bankrupt and would still be a member of parliament
825,the one inescapable conclusion is that as a government minister neil hamilton was more honourable than tony blair is
826,as the first phase of the official inquiry into the death of victoria climbie drew to a close yesterday this is perhaps a good moment to recall the words of lord laming the chairman of the inquiry on the opening of the proceedings some months ago
827,at that time he said that he hoped that the climbie case would mark a turning point and that the lessons of the case would result in proper protection for vulnerable and abused children in britain
828,lord laming is certainly right to hope for such an outcome but the long list of previous high profile childabuse cases suggests otherwise
829,victoria climbies name joins those of kimberley carlile jasmine beckford maria colwell shirley woodcock and many others all of which had a similar shocking impact on the public and the authorities but sadly seemed to have no lasting effect
830,it is obviously unrealistic to expect that we will never again see a case like that of victoria climbie but it is not too much to ask that the same mistakes be not made time and again by the authorities and voluntary agencies that work in the field
831,in particular the government needs to take urgent action to deal with the standards of some local authorities social services departments
832,it bears repeating that the abuse of victoria climbie amounting to the torture and indeed the murder of the eightyearold took place not in some quasiprison or care home but in the community
833,her injuries were inflicted over a period of many months and were seen by hospital staff and by social workers
834,carole baptiste the haringey social worker whose job it was to oversee the climbie case was apparently developing a serious psychotic mental illness at the time
835,documents have been lost
836,however time and again and far too often we find with a sense of depressing inevitability that social workers have in some way been found wanting in the discharge of their vital duties
837,often it is also the case that the resources are not there to employ sufficient social workers or to attract the best into the field
838,sometimes monies intended for the care of the most vulnerable are diverted by councils
839,although it is right that ministers should spend so much of their time and effort on setting targets and rating performance in our schools and hospitals there has long been the feeling that social services have been very much a cinderella public service
840,nor should we be afraid to ask tough questions about race did the idea that black cultural norms must always be respected contribute to victorias neglect
841,if the climbie case and all those that preceded it is about anything it is about the need for a thorough overhaul of the funding and staffing of social services departments in every local authority in the country
842,this has to be undertaken by central government because as the cynical and obstructive attitude of haringey council demonstrates it seems beyond many town halls to accept responsibility for their failings
843,at the same time the role of the nspcc in this case also leaves something to be desired and should act as a stark warning to all those who feel that a greater role for the voluntary sector welcome as it may often be is some sort of guarantee of higher standards of care
844,victoria climbie was referred to a nspcc family centre in august
845,the inquiry heard that no effort was made to see the child because staff were preoccupied with organising a party
846,so let us hope that the climbie case will mark a turning point for the lamentable standards that seem to prevail in social services
847,this will need pressure from whitehall and so far there is little sign of it being applied
848,have i ever mentioned that i come from woodman stock
849,not woodman in the sense of wild man from the primeval undergrowth or hunter of game in the queens forests but woodman as in sensualist of the plank
850,my father was one of those men who went nowhere without a saw in his hand a sheet of sandpaper in his pocket and nails in his mouth
851,a jew is by rhyming slang a fourbytwo but those measurements cut no ice in our house
852,twobyone that was my fathers first love and for the perfect length of twobyone dead straight when you pointed it at the south pole and cast your eye along its length so smooth you could sleep entwined around it he would have swapped his offspring
853,fortunately he never found what he was looking for
854,perhaps he knew he never dared
855,the search for it informed his life though making him sad and introspective in the end a haunter of timber merchants and junk yards someone who went into bookshops only to examine the shelves and who fell into a brown study when we visited relatives who through poverty or design lived in uncarpeted rooms
856,while the rest of us took tea and talked he would sit with his head between his knees sizing up the floorboards and cutting them into the ideal dimensions in his imagination
857,a good job we werenot still living in the forests of podolia in log cabins
858,unless that was exactly what he was missing
859,though no chip off the old block myself all i ever made after five years of learning woodwork at school was a splint to hold the finger id broken while trying to plane a lid for someone elses pencil box i am still fondly reminded of these my timbery beginnings by the newspaper photographs of those thousands of tons of swedish pine washed up on the cornish coast last week all the firewood in hell enough matchwood to keep the devils furnaces aflame for ever
860,if ever you wondered what conceptual artists were striving for here once and for all it is constructed with sufficient absence of construction to make every one of them from the most plainly functional to the most superfluously grandiose from carl andr the bricklayer to old clingwrap christo himself eat their own hearts
861,behold every art clich of the last years the objet trouv with a vengeance the ordinary become amazing scale changing meaning the natural become unnatural space and volume redefined litter striving to be beauteous beauty striving to be litter the gallery rendered otiose randomness made magisterial materials mocking their origin for here is a towering forest of that which came from forests and best of all the artist nowhere to be seen
862,god the great conceptualist
863,charles saatchi must be looking to sign him up even as we speak and serota wondering how to squeeze him on to the shortlist for this years turner
864,can god giggle like a ninny when they offer him the cheque
865,god is all powerful
866,he can do anything
867,did he not make andy warhol employing none of the elements we normally associate with life
868,i would like to think that the cornish have been out in their thousands thronging the shoreline to marvel at this glorious sight art rescued from the wreck of commerce destruction itself destroyed
869,but by all accounts they have just been driving to the sea and filling the boots of their cars with offcuts
870,perhaps they marvelled first and scavenged later
871,wrecking they call this down there
872,i lived among the cornish once and recall more than one occasion when the word went around that there were valuables being washed in on the tide
873,out came the torches and the wellington boots and off wed all troop prepared to climb down ropes thousands of feet into the raging blackness disturbing the homes of screaming sea birds swaying in the gale howling falling breaking limbs half drowning sometimes in order to lay our hands on some punctured sack of sodden tea or box of christmas decorations fabricated in taiwan and now smashed into a thousand pieces
874,then up the cliffs wed haul ourselves again clasping our treasures to our chests a shining example of the truism that it is not the winning that matters but the taking part
875,and all the following day the village would be alive with tales of our adventures
876,such things wed found down there
877,gold and silver
878,watches cut from dead mens wrists
879,rings pulled from the whitened fingers of society women still fragrant but destined to cruise the oceans of the world no more
880,a tiara no less seen floating in a rockpool at first mistaken for a jellyfish
881,wrecking is a form of social vengefulness you see
882,a way of seeing to it that what goes around comes around
883,imperial caesar dead and turned to clay stopping a hole to keep the wind away
884,a rafter meant for a palace now a kitchen shelf in portwrinkle
885,though he was no climber i can picture my father down there on the beach in seventh heaven a retractable measure in his hand a pencil in his ear perhaps sawing a plank over one knee something he tried to teach me to do once until my mother hearing the saw cutting through cartilage came running out and stopped him
886,he didnot mean me to have no legs
887,he just wanted me to love wood as he did
888,what a disappointment i was to him
889,but it could have been worse
890,he could have had andy warhol for a son
891,so the politicians especially tessa jowell the secretary of state for culture media and sport are worried that the bbc is considering dumbing down its coverage of politics
892,but few apart from political junkies such as me would necessarily blame greg dyke the director general for looking at new ways of making politics less boring to viewers
893,the fact is that apathy reflected at the low turnout in elections is also mirrored in the turnoff that politics has become for many viewers and listeners
894,before the politicians get too high and mighty they should momentarily spare a thought for mr dyke as he wonders why so few normal people especially the young actually watch his excellent programmes on politics
895,donot get me wrong i am not against the desire to maintain the interest of the viewer in politics and i think that any attempt to reduce the output of political coverage would be a mistake
896,in fact more than that i also have a financial interest to declare
897,i am privileged to take part in many political programmes broadcast by the corporation and i would suffer financially as a consequence
898,i find it ironic however that i have the opportunity of participating far more these days on radio and television than i ever did as an mp
899,maybe that should tell us something
900,it could be that tied to a whip a pager and a political script i had nothing useful to say
901,now that i have to use my brain instead of my pager perhaps i might appear more interesting
902,at present the bbc provides extensive coverage of politics and the proceedings of the house of commons
903,i do not think there has ever been a time when there has been so much coverage
904,just consider an average sunday
905,on television it starts with breakfast with frost and this is followed at lunchtime by on the record
906,meanwhile radio provides broadcasting house in the morning and the westminster hour in the evening
907,meanwhile radio live offers us sunday service
908,that adds up to five hours of indepth and extensive political coverage excluding radio 4s lunchtime news show the world this weekend
909,for a day on which many are seeking a rest from political debate i reckon if anything the bbc is actually going well beyond its call of public duty
910,during the week in addition to the regular news and current affairs programmes such as newsnight and today there are other roundups of events in parliament
911,dispatch box on bbc was added to the political stable of the corporation four years ago and provides a 30minute nightly magazine roundup and also includes robust live studio discussion
912,admittedly this programme is for insomniacs because it goes out after midnight but then since parliament does not adjourn until 1030pm
913,it is hardly possible to put out such a programme much earlier
914,and then there are the two hourlong westminster live programmes put out on tuesdays and wednesdays which cover question time in the commons and much more
915,add radio 4s yesterday in parliament and today in parliament plus saturdays week in westminster and this all points to a pretty impressive coverage for what is in large measure just a minority pursuit
916,if anything it can be argued with some justification that the bbcs output has actually increased in recent years
917,so no politician can claim that there has been any dumbingdown yet
918,however greg dyke has a right to ask whether his viewers are actually watching or listening to any of these programmes
919,there are some i am one that say that he has a duty to provide programmes on political affairs regardless of how many are tuning in
920,but he in turn is entitled to ask why so few licencepayers are thanking him for such coverage
921,could it be because it is the politicians themselves rather than the broadcasters who are dumbing down
922,parliament has only itself to blame if its proceedings are such a turnoff
923,and if some of the programmes go out at an inconvenient time could this not be because of the inconvenient hours that the commons currently sits
924,the trouble is that politicians rarely watch or listen to television or radio and maybe are simply unaware of just how unappetising they appear to the rest of us
925,one can hardly blame the bbc for wanting to get away from simply covering the proceedings of a largely empty commons chamber where there are often only a dozen or so mps present
926,the only significant thing that registers in the minds of some viewers is the backcloth of empty green benches
927,perhaps if mps attended the debates in larger numbers there might be more of an incentive to want to watch
928,ironically it has been the provision of the live tv feed to mps in their swanky offices that has been one of the reasons for the decline in attendance
929,then there are the cringemaking labour stooges who ask their idiotic scripted questions along the lines of is the prime minister aware that he is marvellous
930,this week the speaker ruled that the leader of the opposition could not ask the prime minister questions about the labour party and its funding by trade unions implying that mr blair as prime minister was not responsible for the labour party
931,this is bizarre
932,presumably this strict interpretation means that parliament cannot now even question ministers on the leaked labour party health policy document that suggests that the nhs might in future be less than free at point of use
933,the attempts to stifle open debate in the commons mean that for the rest of us the impression is reinforced that parliament is a place where questions in debates simply go unanswered
934,and when anyway so many of the broadcasters are then confronted with the refusal of ministers to appear on programmes who can blame mr dyke for wondering if the manner of political coverage should not be reviewed
935,how many times do we hear interviewers saying we invited a minister to appear but none were available
936,in such circumstances it is the politicians evasions that are responsible for the dumbingdown of their trade
937,it would be sad if politics were to lose the attention of the bbc but it is up to the politicians not mr dyke to make their case
938,as ever market trends are against the way of life of a marginalised community
939,the evidence of the annual caravan show which opened in birmingham yesterday is that the traditional caravan the wheeled kitchenette that you attach to the back of a car is being ousted much in the manner of red squirrels by grey by the allinone mobile home
940,caravanners have been a despised minority for too long
941,they may not have known quite how much they were despised by the drivers of unencumbered vehicles travelling behind their swaying boxes on a motorway but they sensed that they were discriminated against by the mainstream
942,and they knew that they were underrepresented in parliament with only one of their number margaret beckett in the cabinet
943,mobile homes meanwhile have shaken off their image as overgrown camper vans and become fashionable with the help of airconditioning builtin dishwashers and all mod cons
944,surely caravanowners should react by going in the opposite direction back to the simpler holiday life that is true to their origins
945,they could invent a more basic and portable form of accommodation
946,and call it a tent
947,noam chomsky one of americas leading philosophers and an icon of the radical left took centre stage in an istanbul court yesterday when a judge threw out charges against the turkish publisher of his book criticising treatment of the kurdish minority
948,bespectacled and mildmannered mr chomsky cut an unlikely figure in the crowded courtroom where crimes against the state are tried
949,the 72yearold linguistics professor watched as prosecutors abandoned earlier claims and accepted the defence argument that fatih tas of aram publishing had not spread separatist propaganda
950,the charge is often levelled at critics of turkeys policy towards its estimated million kurds
951,bekir rayif aldemir the prosecutor said he understood the book did not seek to divide the turkish nation
952,mr tas faced a year in prison for printing american interventionism a collection of mr chomskys political essays in which he accuses turkey of brutal repression of the kurds
953,the prosecutor clearly made the right decision mr chomsky told reporters after the hearing
954,hopefully this will serve as a step for establishing freedom of speech in turkey
955,mr tas a 22yearold university student has six other cases pending against him carrying a possible 24year prison term all for printing articles or books dealing with the kurdish issue
956,he called yesterdays ruling insincere and suggested the presence of the professor from the massachusetts institute of technology had helped him escape a jail sentence
957,the case was dismissed but this is not a sincere verdict it was given because of mr chomskys support he said
958,no charges were filed against mr chomsky
959,defence lawyers had asked that he be included as a codefendant but prosecutors declined
960,a vocal critic of us foreign policy mr chomsky said before the hearing that americans had a responsibility to monitor and protest against human rights abuses in turkey which is a close ally
961,when the united states provides per cent of arms to turkey for the express purpose of carrying out repression that becomes my responsibility he said
962,the timing of mr chomskys arrival could not have been worse for turkey
963,just a few streets from the state security court where the hearing was held the turkish government was playing host to a highprofile international conference bringing together foreign ministers from islamic and european union countries
964,most of the allegations of human rights abuses in turkey stem from fighting between security forces and kurdish rebels seeking selfrule
965,some people have died in the conflict which began in
966,rebels declared a unilateral ceasefire after the capture of their leader abdullah ocalan and an atmosphere of relative peace now prevails
967,turkey has started phasing out emergency rule in the mainly kurdish regions
968,also in turkey became the first predominantly muslim nation to join the eus list of official candidates for membership
969,but the countrys poor human rights record and the refusal to grant its estimated million kurds greater cultural rights are cited among the chief reasons why entry is continually delayed
970,earlier this month parliament passed a set of human rights reforms intended to help turkey meet eu standards
971,the authenticity of a national gallery rubens has been called into question again
972,the last time samson and delilah was auctioned two decades ago it was the second most expensive painting ever sold
973,that must mean something
974,so apart from the millions of pounds involved and the reputation of our best art historians critics and academics in what way if any does it matter
975,if the most educated experts canot tell for certain whether or not the things a rubens why should we artproles worry
976,what does it lack this almost perfect copy or fake or homage or brilliant pupils effort
977,whats the difference
978,whats the difference indeed between a perfect copy and its original
979,and what else are monday mornings for than to consider the nature and value of art
980,first it must be said perfect copies of oil paintings are impossible
981,your old masters are just too peculiar
982,i donot believe much about art but i do believe that
983,it became clear for me at a frick exhibition of rembrandt self portraits
984,we were kept back from the canvasses by a red rope a couple of feet from the wall
985,you could lean in and inspect the paint as close as you liked limited only by the length of your nose
986,and in doing so something very odd happened
987,rembrandts eye which had been so eloquent so real such a representation of a real eye disappeared when you saw it from four inches away
988,it only reappeared when you leant back an inch or so
989,you leant in and the eye exploded becoming a mess of specks slashes splashes splodges spiral lines
990,its components were chaotic
991,you leant back and there it was harmonious and full of meaning
992,well blank despair at any rate
993,there are more fakeable artists
994,in orson welless film f for fake we saw the great forger elmyr de hory at the easel
995,casually in halfadozen brush strokes hed make a matisse and then throw it on the fire a chagall and throw it on the fire a picasso and throw it on the fire
996,acting in this capacity de hory was a marvellous craftsman rather than an artist but the product what was that
997,what effect would de horys chagalls have had on gallery experts on connoisseurs on ravished collectors
998,in what way would the quality of their experience be different from that provided by the original
999,all the aesthetes whove sat in front of samson and delilah over the years working themselves up into a lather over the brushwork what will they say if and when rubens is declared innocent of the painting
1000,they who have been moved who claim to have been changed how will they reconcile their new state to this betrayal
1001,picasso regularly used to be to be asked to authenticate works that were sold as his
1002,he always refused there are too many picassos around he said
1003,it depresses the price
1004,one time he was told the piece hed condemned as a fake was indeed from his own hand
1005,sometimes i fake picassos he said
1006,thats an interesting idea
1007,when he imitates his own mannerisms he fakes himself
1008,yes there is something in a masterpiece that speaks to us across the generations
1009,the second rate or the thirdrate the brilliant copies and the awful fakes reveal themselves in time
1010,a madonna and child forgery from the 1920s became obvious quite suddenly years afterwards when the similarity between the madonna and clara bow was observed for the first time
1011,it is one of those media friendly terms that covers up a multitude
1012,alcohol related illnesses
1013,this week we were told that these illnesses are in danger of destroying the nhs and are responsible for deaths every year and that eight out of people attending emergency units have alcohol related injuries
1014,in a society that encourages us to escape pain rather than face it alcohol is the favourite anaesthetic
1015,yet alcohol related illnesses doesnot have the oh my god scareyouwitless letsfindacurefast resonance of a word such as cancer or leukaemia nor is it loaded with dread like the phrase sexually transmitted disease
1016,how many people hear alcoholrelated illness and think of a sick head in the morning a transitory discomfort that will be gone by afternoon
1017,before i get going let me enter an all too important caveat i am not remotely antibooze
1018,god bless good wine and beer and whiskey beakers full of the warm south with beaded bubbles winking at the brim and purple stained mouth etc
1019,or as flann obriens poet of the people put it when eulogising guinness stout in the comic masterpiece at swim two birds when food is scarce and your larder bare and no rashers grease your pan
1020,a pint of plain is your only man
1021,if you can drink and not succumb to one of those mysterious alcoholrelated illnesses the best of luck to you
1022,but if you are one of those whom booze seduces and then betrays if you spend your days and nights chasing the warm rainbow then this weeks news should be very scary indeed
1023,are you the one in company who is watching the wine bottle and wondering whether the others will think it odd if you order another and then saying to hell with what they think
1024,or the one who sees a friend leaving a glass of wine unfinished and wonders what in gods name is wrong with them
1025,maybe you are the guy who wakes up and for a few terrifying minutes has no earthly idea where he is or what he did last night or the woman who rolls over and looks into the face of a stranger and wonders if she will be able to get up and get dressed and escape before they wake
1026,and if you have known that morning where nothing lifts you not beer or wine or whiskey then alcoholrelated illness is already with you
1027,its screwing with your head and in time will get around to your body
1028,that poor body
1029,theres no end of misery that alcohol can bring
1030,liver pancreas heart bowel slowly poisoned to death
1031,thats usually well under way before the exterior starts falling apart before pissing blood and the yellow pallor and parchment skin before the amputated leg or the body immobilised by a stroke before the brain reduced to mush from all those tides of booze washing over it down the years
1032,i have been to the funerals of many friends who have fallen into alcoholic death
1033,it is never ever an easy death
1034,scrub from your mind forever the notion of a romantic drunkards death disregard every admiring profile you read of the rebellious drunken singerpoet
1035,i read that rubbish and think of a man who choked to death on his own vomit a man who died of heart failure and wasnot found for a week the beautiful woman with an angels voice found bloated and poisoned on her kitchen floor a man who died far from those he loved in a small room in a town where nobody knew him
1036,every one of them left people behind burdened with the question why
1037,alcoholrelated illnesses
1038,if you have ever visited a hospital for alcoholics on a weekend when the kids are visiting youll have seen the illness in its saddest and most cruel form
1039,take a lawn full of drunks and their families and contemplate the fact that at best only a quarter will recover from alcoholism
1040,regard every alcoholrelated illness as a huge stone cast into a small pond as a family broken and bewildered made sick too by the disease in its midst
1041,i agree with alcohol concern there is no bigger health crisis facing britain
1042,yet we remain curiously indifferent to the damage done to family life and the immense burden being placed on the health service
1043,ask any recovering alcoholic and they gladly accept that responsibility for their sobriety is theirs alone
1044,but that is the rationale of a person who has made the first vital step towards recognising that a problem exists
1045,the first obstacle is the chronic denial around alcoholic illness
1046,it is everywhere around us the elephant in the sitting room we refuse to acknowledge
1047,hardly a family in the land is unaffected by the problem most people know a cousin or a friend who battles with booze yet there was a sense of shock when this weeks statistics were unveiled
1048,it is difficult for families to face up to the issue in a society that is awash with denial
1049,booze is embedded in our national rituals the socially acceptable drug
1050,far easier to rave on about heroin and junkies than to face alcohol addiction
1051,popular culture celebrates drunkenness for a good example of what i mean witness the moronic behaviour trotted out on itvs holiday reps programme each week
1052,we ban cigarette advertising from television but allow the continued flogging of booze
1053,we have highalcohol drinks cynically aimed at the most vulnerable i mean imagine the marketing strategy behind special brew
1054,just who is the target market
1055,i can think of two immediate candidates the young and the poor with little money who want to get pissed fast and the alcoholic chasing oblivion
1056,when victims of alcohol abuse get sick they find a medical system woefully ill equipped to deal with the crisis
1057,alcohol concern carried out a survey last august that found that per cent of doctors and nurses interviewed felt they had insufficient information to help dependent drinkers
1058,you might imagine that with alcohol costing the nhs 3bn a year politicians might express a sense of urgency
1059,but like the rest of us they are cocooned in denial
1060,this isnot a crisis that can be solved with drugs
1061,they can help you out of detox but meaningful treatment depends on skilled counsellors
1062,right now we have a chronic shortage of hospital places for those suffering from alcoholic illnesses
1063,we dry out the drunks and put them back on the street and they come back again and again
1064,many find their way into the criminal justice system
1065,not just the street drunks banged away for being drunk and disorderly but also the businessmen and women hauled off to the cells because theyve trashed the house or committed an assault the man who kills in the middle of a blackout
1066,i normally rush for the door when i hear a politician or civil servant droning on about coordinated strategy
1067,but the scale of damage being done by alcohol related illness demands action across the widest range of areas
1068,it means a huge increase in funding for alcoholism treatment and research and a willingness on the part of political leaders and the media to end the denial
1069,we must talk about this stuff that kills so many bring the healthcare professionals the criminal justice system the media and the drinks industry into a public debate
1070,to the millions caught in the middle of this nightmare something better is owed than the present dishonest shambles
1071,rather as basil fawlty couldnot stop talking about the war to his german guests so peter hain the minister for europe finds it almost impossible to stop talking about the euro even though he knows he shouldnot
1072,in a conversation with le figaro that can hardly fail to inflame the treasury mr hain has just floated a detailed timetable for potential british entry into the single currency pointing to a referendum in the spring and autumn of
1073,as it happens mr hains remarks were not part of some plot to soften up british opinion for entry
1074,today jack straw travels to the hague to make an important speech on the future of european institutions
1075,in it the foreign secretary will set out some of the latest british thinking in advance of the convention due to begin at the end of this month under the chairmanship of valery giscard destaing
1076,it was hardly in the interests of mr hain as the senior british representative on the convention to do anything to distract from his bosss focus on the daunting exercise in constitutionbuilding in which he will be taking part
1077,whats more mr hain didnot really confide in le figaro anything that isnot a very open secret in whitehall namely that a working hypothesis exists that would allow a euroreferendum as early as spring
1078,and while what mr hain said wasnot really new some of what mr straw says today will be
1079,true the intriguing idea of in effect a fulltime president of the eu at the very least complementary to the commission president is floated as an option in terms so opaque as to be almost invisible
1080,but others such as rotating the presidencies of the ministerial councils which cover subjects ranging from agriculture to the environment every two and a half years and making those council chairs an executive board responsible for the daytoday running of the eu are substantive
1081,and what will shine through is the british belief that it is the ministerial and prime ministerial councils that must be strengthened
1082,while there are also ideas for entrenching the european parliaments rights of scrutiny it is the councils composed of representatives of elected national governments which in british eyes principally give the eu democratic legitimacy
1083,but if mr hains fawltystyle tic did not produce anything new it was a reminder if needed of how difficult it is to stay silent about what everyone agrees is by far the biggest decision the government will have to take in the coming year whether to call a referendum on the euro
1084,it does not reflect a change of policy which remains in favour of entry in principle but only if and when mr browns five economic tests are met
1085,however what it does reflect perhaps subconsciously is a subtle but perceptible change in the weather
1086,it always used to be said subject of course to the tests that mr blair would call a referendum on the euro if and when he thought he could win
1087,that no longer has much meaning if it ever did
1088,first it implies a greater detachment on the prime ministers part than is justified
1089,by all accounts mr blair wants it enough to take what he believes is a justifiable risk
1090,he isnot persuaded by the argument shared by a few in downing street and many more in the treasury that it would be better to wait until perhaps by which time the euro would be such a fact of life that the british people would sleepwalk into it
1091,he is it is said much more sympathetic to the argument that to wait until then would sap britains credibility in europe would reduce perhaps fatally britains chances of filling the leadership vacuum in the eu and would make it more difficult to reshape policy not least to take one topical example on the overrigid stability pact which gordon brown has rightly inveighed against
1092,but above all he is said to be increasingly optimistic that he could win in
1093,whats more it looks as if mr blair is right
1094,its not just that there is gradually increasing polling evidence that once the government assuming it has the necessary support of mr brown had recommended entry there could be a majority in favour
1095,its also that further detailed preparatory work strongly reinforces it
1096,in particular focusgroup research for britain in europe suggests that apart from a substantial hardcore minority of opponents the thirst for information on emu and the publics willingness to take the government seriously as providers of it is great just as with say aids or the millennium bug
1097,i yield to no one in my scepticism of focus groups
1098,but this is much in line with what any reporter on the road during the general election could hear with their own ears
1099,selfdeclared opponents of entry if pushed would say first that they didnot know enough about it and secondly that no one is really making the case for it
1100,the qualitative research suggests that some of the proeuro messages from avoiding isolation to enjoying lower prices play very powerfully
1101,mr hain a veteran of the welsh referendum knows all this
1102,one counterargument is this supposing mr blair became unpopular and the referendum became one on his premiership rather as the french maastricht referendum was on franois mitterands record
1103,well given that mr blairs popularity remains undented after the pounding he has had in the last few weeks its difficult to see how this would happen
1104,in that sense ministers may be right when they say that the press may be less in touch than they are
1105,that isnot to say a referendum would not be a gamble albeit a sensible one
1106,if the cabinet were to hold an unprecedented event a substantive meeting on the issue there would probably be a majority in favour of doing what mr blair wanted because he wanted it
1107,margaret beckett appears to be a striking if tentative convert
1108,but there are caveats
1109,firstly there are strong ministerial voices arguing for example that an euwide interest rate could leave higher taxes or spending cuts as the only inflationfighting weapon thus jeopardising all labours promises an argument that could resurface in a referendum
1110,secondly euroentry is not exactly a priority for other cabinet ministers
1111,focused on their departments they arenot yet geared up for the fight but the big caveat is mr brown
1112,whether and how he moves from his present deep caution remains the most fascinating question in british politics
1113,by all accounts the big meeting between the two is yet to happen
1114,but while mr blair whose enthusiasm is well attested is a necessary condition he is not sufficient
1115,now it is the chancellor who is both a necessary and sufficient condition for entry
1116,there is a link between all this and mr straws speech even though he will not dwell on the euro
1117,firstly because a europe on the lines that he will suggest could make euroentry more congenial to the doubters
1118,but secondly because he will offer a robust defence of the eu and of pooling sovereignty to achieve domestic goals
1119,but that should not disguise the central fact
1120,the key issue is no longer so much one of agonising over whether the british people can wear it but of what is the dynamic within the government
1121,there are more important things in life than cate blanchetts breasts but not many
1122,all the australian film star had to do was turn up at the premiere of her new movie last week wearing a revealing dress and the column inches filled up as if by magic
1123,admittedly blanchett was wearing a nice frock unlike most of the models who took part in london fashion week skin jewellery and a bearded lady were two of this years highlights but a photograph of her cupping her breasts was enough to prompt fevered speculation
1124,had blanchett dropped a cup size so to speak as a result of pregnancy
1125,the films producers must have been delighted as their star effortlessly extended the free publicity they had already received
1126,the contemporary fascination with womens bodies is a gift to anyone who has something to sell
1127,at the same time it is a strange feature of a culture that could reasonably be described as obsessed with breasts that we seem to know very little about them
1128,i have not had children myself but even i know that childbirth produces physiological changes
1129,so do the contraceptive pill and getting older which explains why the female population is buying bras in larger cup sizes than it did years ago
1130,yet blanchetts appearance in a lowcut dress prompted trawls though picture libraries for before and after photographs as well as confessions from other famous mothers who had experienced this alteration
1131,it may be that in an era when womens breasts swell and shrink on the tables of cosmetic surgeons we have forgotten that changes in breast size are a natural phenomenon
1132,to be fair almost as much excitement was generated last week by kylie minogues bottom which was on show in a fetching minidress at the brit awards
1133,in recent weeks columnists have been wheeled out to explain why we like kylie so much more than britney spears she has even been hailed as a symbol of everything the taliban hated about the modern world
1134,this is quite a weight for minogues diminutive frame to bear and it suggests that the more womens bodies are on display the more they need explaining and decoding
1135,of course this is something to do with the fact that most women donot look like blanchett or minogue and tend to be in a state of permanent anxiety about their appearance
1136,we no longer know what natural women look like but movie stars and models are no more representative than the ordinary women who are involved in a daily struggle to control their weight
1137,in that sense even the most perfect female body has become a plethora of signs pregnant with the prospect of its own disintegration famous women in their twenties are studied minutely for signs of cosmetic surgery anorexia weight gain or an unannounced pregnancy
1138,the inspection is clinical enough when the women are young blanchett is and gave birth to her first child in december but positively lethal when they get older
1139,spotting the signs of ageing has become a spectator sport princess diana was only when she died but royal watchers had already detected dimpled thighs while nicole kidman and jerry hall were both accused of committing the sin of cellulite last year
1140,what is so unpleasant about all this is the atmosphere of blame in which it is carried out as though getting older is a lifestyle choice made by lazy women rather than a natural process
1141,kylie may have a perfect bottom at but she wonot in years time as columnists will delight in telling her
1142,when bad people do evil things then those who profit most are other bad people its like they have a sort of arrangement with each other
1143,we have already seen the israeli government of ariel sharon taking advantage of last tuesdays attacks in new york by invading palestinian areas and murdering their citizens more or less at random
1144,of course with the impeccable instinct for public relations that palestinians have always shown some of the silly bastards allowed themselves to be taped celebrating the events at the world trade centre theres one fat woman in ugly specs whose witless grinning gob will stay with me for a long time
1145,but then years of poverty humiliation and cruelty do not amazingly automatically make you into a good kind or sensible person
1146,however i am left wondering given how much circumstances always seem to conspire against the entirely reasonable cause of the palestinian people whether they wouldnot be better off in the end just jacking the whole thing in giving up closing the business shutting up shop with the whole lookingfor justice thing because its not really working out is it
1147,yasser arafat might be wise to issue a statement saying something like look lads weve given it a good go but every time we think weare getting somewhere then some bloody thing happens which strengthens our enemies and puts us back to square zero
1148,i mean i know our only crime in the first place was to be somewhere where a load of people from europe wanted to be but theres too many powerful forces ranged against us so all of your mates at the plo high command have decided weare going to knock the whole protest on the head
1149,from now on weare going to let the israelis push us around steal our land destroy our homes and weare going to let them do it without a bleat of protest
1150,from now the fateh supreme council can be contacted via a bed and breakfast hotel in dover
1151,see you around yasser hanan and all the gang
1152,seeing the destruction wrought in the united states watching all the various odious factions scrambling for advantage unable to understand anything except their own twisted point of view made me think what a nasty dangerous species we really are
1153,though human beings have the manual dexterity to manufacture all kinds of complex machines our brains donot seem to have evolved at the same pace as our fingers so that what we have in us is a creature with the basic mentality of a coyote but with the ability to create all manner of terrible weapons
1154,a while ago the sunday times asked me to take part in selecting photographs taken from years of the magnum photographic agency the theme was to be celebrating the human spirit
1155,along with others i was to select six pictures and to write my comments in hand on the back for later publication in the magazine
1156,however when i came to look at these blackandwhite images what i saw was a species so in love with itself and totally blind to its faults
1157,i remember i chose one image of mother theresa and wrote from what ive read about this woman she was a rather nasty piece of work
1158,in this photo you can see the selfindulgent vanity shining out of her
1159,as they say on the jerry springer show she think she all that but she ainot
1160,other pictures were meant to illustrate the supposed miracle of yet another child born to clog up the planet
1161,funnily enough the sunday times chose not to print my pictures or my comments
1162,all they wanted was gooey stuff about the indomitable human spirit the fantastic wonderful specialness of our maggoty little species they didnot want anybody wondering whether the planet wouldnot be a lot better off without us screwing it up
1163,i know that james cameron and arnold schwarzenegger are currently working on the third in the terminator series of movies
1164,maybe in this latest version the heroes should be skynet the computer that wants to wipe out mankind and cyberdyne systems manufacturers of the killer cyborgs
1165,after a titanic struggle john connor the leader of the human resistance is defeated and our kind is wiped from the face of the earth
1166,the machines convert themselves into singing cappuccino machines or fly off to explore other worlds or miniaturise themselves until they are the size of an atom and the planet that formerly housed us begins to heal itself
1167,the rainforests start to regrow over the shattered landscape cute furry almost extinct animals emerge to sniff the air and to repopulate the seas again teem with life the skies grow dark with birds
1168,and maybe when you think about it george w bush might be arranging that situation for us right now
1169,the money ainot the problem
1170,its what you do with it
1171,the developed world has taken on board the task of rebuilding the shattered economy of afghanistan and has just pledged 18bn
1172,13bn
1173,in the first year to this end with a total of 45bn
1174,over the next few years
1175,that is already nearly half way to the un target of 10bn although the world bank reckons that billion will eventually be needed
1176,the task now is to make sure that the money does not disappear down a black hole and that there is a viable economy that can sustain a decent standard of life for its people when the aid cheques run out
1177,can it be done
1178,afghanistan ranks at or about the bottom of the world scale on most conventional measures of human endeavour insofar as figures are available at all
1179,life expectancy is
1180,years out of every children die before they are five per cent of the population are undernourished and only a third of the adults can read and write
1181,it is in that unpleasant expression so often used nowadays a failed state
1182,if it can come right that would be a wonderful demonstration to the rest of the world that out of catastrophe can come if not triumph at least a modicum of success
1183,the first thing to appreciate is that there are clear limits to what outsiders can achieve
1184,consider the money now pledged it is tiny by the standards of developed countries but enormous by the standards of afghanistan
1185,the whole 45bn
1186,of which the uks share is 288m is less than the british taxpayer spent last year in eradicating foot andmouth disease
1187,put another way we spent four times as much on the dome as we are spending on afghanistan
1188,but relative to the afghan economy the money is big
1189,there are no reliable statistics for its gdp but it is probably about 20bn a year
1190,there are some million people but per capita income is only around per cent lower than in neighbouring tajikistan and only half that of pakistan
1191,so the aid flow will be more than per cent of gdp per annum and a lot more in the first year
1192,that ought to be enough to make a material difference to the countrys wellbeing
1193,but it has to be a lasting difference
1194,some day the cheques will dry up and the expensive consultants in their white range rovers will go back home
1195,in any case these are proud independent people who would not want to live off the meagre handouts of western aid agencies even if these continued to be available
1196,it would be nice to think that the various western experts from the world bank and other agencies were going to be more successful at encouraging selfsustaining development here than they have been in for example most of africa
1197,but their track record is discouraging
1198,are there any reasons to suppose that years from now afghanistan will be seen as even a modest success
1199,actually i think there are
1200,but it will be largely because of them not us
1201,we know enough about economic development to realise that there are several necessary but insufficient conditions for success
1202,there has for a start to be physical safety
1203,it is not just that wars are immensely destructive of wealth which of course they are but conditions of lawlessness greatly raise the cost of any economic activity
1204,there is no point trying to create a business if the proceeds are liable to be stolen local people donot bother and potential outside investors have plenty of other opportunities and stay away
1205,it now seems a reasonable assumption that there will be a period of reasonable order or at least conditions where order is possible
1206,that creates a climate where contracts can be made and enforced where titles to land and property are respected and therefore where businesses can be allowed to develop
1207,next the basic physical infrastructure has to work adequately well
1208,if you have power cuts it becomes impossible to run the basic essentials of a modern economy such as computers and faxes
1209,roads have to be passable in bad weather the water has to be on the airport has to be functioning flights have to be at affordable prices and of course health care has to be adequate too
1210,again there seems a reasonable possibility that most of this physical infrastructure will be fixed to an acceptable level in the next five years
1211,there is also a reasonable possibility that living conditions will be sufficiently attractive to encourage skilled people to return to afghanistan to run the infrastructure something that is just as important as basic reconstruction
1212,next there has to be a functioning state performing core services and able to collect taxes to pay for these
1213,there has to be a functioning banking system enabling and encouraging savings and lending in order to finance economic activity
1214,this too looks set to happen
1215,so it is possible to be reasonable optimistic about these necessary but insufficient conditions for economic recovery
1216,to a fair extent these are problems that money and technical help can solve
1217,but ultimately whether the country is successful will turn on other less easily generated and less easily identified qualities
1218,these have to come from within
1219,on the face of it the country seems short of things opium poppies aside to sell to the rest of the world
1220,it will gradually have to find these
1221,there are some obvious possibilities for example ecotourism and the export of traditional craft products
1222,the economy will be supported too by emigrants remittances and has in the diaspora a body of skills and contacts that could be of enormous help in the future
1223,but all experience of successful economic development is that it is impossible to plan success
1224,instead you have to remove blockages to development spot market signals that suggest that there is an opportunity and then try and reinforce it
1225,the greatest reason for hope though is what has been happening in the last few weeks
1226,within a few days of the end of hostilities there was a burst of economic activity
1227,shops opened trading began
1228,despite extraordinarily difficult circumstances the economy got going again
1229,this is an enormously encouraging signal for afghanistan
1230,who could quibble with the new measures that usher in electronic tagging for persistent child offenders awaiting trial
1231,not police chiefs who have been pleading for ages for just such a system
1232,at last they have got their wish and pilot schemes will commence in six areas in eight weeks going nationwide in june
1233,senior officers complaints have focused particularly but far from exclusively on london presently in the grip of a crime wave
1234,they estimate that up to young offenders acting as if they are immune to the law are operating in each london borough
1235,each time they are arrested and put on bail they apparently get straight back out on the streets to commit further crimes or to intimidate witnesses
1236,they are adept at playing the system and often do not turn up for their trials so new dates have to be set and witnesses lose interest
1237,now instead of simply releasing them prior to their trials the courts will be able to order tagging
1238,the suspects will then have to wear ankle bands linked to a unit in their home and connected to a computer
1239,the control will be backed by a nighttime curfew
1240,the great and undeniable advantage is that it is far far better than nothing
1241,which right now is all that courts confronted with an innocentuntilprovenguilty child can offer
1242,one could be forgiven for being under the impression that dealing with this very problem of persistent young offending was one of the main pledges that got the blair government delivered to power in the election
1243,the solution then as i recall was fasttrack custodial sentencing
1244,is this new move then simply confirmation that the crime and disorder act has not worked
1245,it would seem that way to the cynical observer who has been hearing about how persistent young offenders flout the law for years
1246,but in fact the reduction in time between arrest and sentencing targeted by the government was reached and outstripped some while ago
1247,as for the custodial sentences well the youth prisons are full to bursting conditions in some are terrible and they are worsening
1248,retributive punishment is being exacted in this country at a faster clip than ever often against the same people again and again and again
1249,more prisons are being built at a cracking pace even though the success of the governments moves to tackle young offending so far have proved one thing beyond doubt prison does not work
1250,if this sounds like a contradiction in terms it isnot
1251,if all goes well and despite appearances it still could the new prisons will not be supplementing the old victorian ones but replacing them
1252,and god knows those grim disgusting ancient institutions need replacing
1253,they need replacing with more liberal institutions in which the emphasis is not on punishment but rehabilitation
1254,and the institutions that are having the most success with young offenders are the ones doing just that
1255,for decades public feeling has been stirred up against the very idea of soft options
1256,but it is the practical options that work
1257,a young offenders institution in reading for example scored a hit simply by cottoning on to the fact that the southeast was crying out for forklift truck drivers
1258,training young offenders resulted in per cent of those on the course finding work on leaving prison
1259,only three have reoffended
1260,compare that per cent to the per cent of 1416yearolds who reoffend and the efficacy of retraining becomes obvious
1261,and tagging despite its bad press can work just as well
1262,the trouble is that its not much good on its own
1263,tagging works as part of an issp intensive supervision and surveillance programme
1264,these have been up and running for some time with educational courses drug rehabilitation and schemes in which reparations are made to victims
1265,issps though will not apply in the short term to the children affected under david blunketts new measures
1266,they will have to wait until they are convicted for the mercies of practical help and expert training to enter their lives
1267,and it is that great irony that sums up the impasse between rightwing and liberal attitudes to young criminals as well as the internal contradictions held within the leftliberal view
1268,the right howls about the unfairness of the most antisocial of young people being the ones who get most help
1269,they continue to bay for blood despite the fact that their tough punitive attitudes have been in the ascendancy for decades now
1270,they do not want offenders to be helped
1271,they want them to be made examples of
1272,but at the same time the left is at fault for a different reason
1273,liberals while insisting that young offenders receive education tailored to their needs are the first people to complain when it is suggested that helping children vulnerable to drifting into crime might be more sensible at an earlier stage
1274,training young offenders to be forklift drivers is lauded while offering children or entire schools courses in which vocational or practical skills are taught alongside academic ones is viewed with distrust
1275,what a weird unhelpful contradiction this is
1276,yes it is unfair that disturbed children get the attention they crave only after they have become criminals
1277,but the rightwing answer denying them this is wrong
1278,likewise the conservative call for difficult schoolchildren to be put into sin bins is wrong
1279,what isnot wrong though is realising that many very young people in this country need the kind of guidance that issps can offer before they even break the law or are caught doing it
1280,iam not suggesting here that difficult children should be treated like young criminals
1281,instead iam suggesting that young criminals should be treated like difficult children
1282,the strategies for dealing with young people who are not coping with the education system as it stands should be similar whether or not they have committed crimes
1283,it is mad for an institution on the inside to be considered loonily liberal because it offers manual job training and drug rehab and one on the outside to be labelled a sin bin because it can offer lost youngsters similar help
1284,the annoying thing is that the government appears to know this
1285,its policies point rather lamely in a direction whereby this happy state of affairs might be achieved
1286,but again and again this government ducks the real business of politics
1287,instead of winning hearts and minds it prefers to take the cowards way out and spin its nottooliberal policies so that they appease rather than inspire those on both sides of the political divide
1288,the result is not quite but something akin to entropy
1289,instead unbelievably the police the judiciary and the prison system are blamed for rising crime
1290,isnot it pretty obvious that without crime we would not need these institutions at all
1291,they need to be viewed as part of the solution not part of the problem
1292,to this end they all need reform the judiciary being the only one that has ducked it and the one that needs it most
1293,but these are merely the bodies that deal with the human detritus we call criminals
1294,it is our wider world that makes them
1295,diaries exposing the secret life of kurt cobain the nirvana singer who killed himself eight years ago have been sold to a publishing house for 28m
1296,cobains estate which is managed by his widow courtney love struck the deal with riverhead books a us subsidiary of the british media giant pearson after fierce bidding
1297,the journals which are said to include frank accounts of cobains battles with depression and heroin addiction are likely to be published this year
1298,cobain who was when he killed himself in began writing his diaries when he was a teenager and continued during his to fame
1299,james barber who assists ms love in managing the estate told an american newspaper yesterday that the diaries contained areally cool stuff
1300,there are revelations about encounters with groupies and a handwritten draft of smells like teen spirit which took the seattle grunge band to the top of the charts
1301,there are also lists of cobains favourite records rules he set for the band and letters from fans
1302,although the publication is bound to provoke renewed speculation about the life and death of the controversial star mr barber insisted the estate was conscious of protecting his reputation
1303,hes not here and our responsibility is to promote his creativity and his legacy he said
1304,julie grau editorial director of riverhead part of penguin putnam said the journals are an intimate portrait of an artist of great influence
1305,they were a vital source for charles crosss biography of the singer heavier than heaven after he was granted access to them by courtney love
1306,she has provoked much criticism before and since cobains death in standing accused of manipulating him in life and then exerting unreasonable control of his legacy
1307,when i was about i worked in an office
1308,every morning there would be that little joke where anyone who arrived five minutes late would say morning and everyone would call back afternoon
1309,the next joke would come at about when the boss would take his coffee cup across to the sink to rinse it out
1310,every day hed say just going off to wash my thing ha ha ha
1311,and every day i wished i had the guts to wait five minutes say just going off to wash my thing then walk to the sink get my knob out and scrub it with a dishcloth
1312,like most office workers i never had any idea of the purpose of my office though the supervisor does his best to make out the job is extremely important when you first get there
1313,well its a pleasure to have you with us as a vital part of the team
1314,youll be sitting here with harold and every morning the newspapers will be delivered to your desk here
1315,now your job is to go through all those newspapers one by one very carefully indeed and colour in the os
1316,be very careful not to do the noughts in the sports pages and when youve finished hand them across to harold for authorisation
1317,and poor harold whos been there years will say cor blimey its like a madhouse in here sometimes
1318,we were in here until past seven one night you know
1319,the evening newspaper had a big article about yoko ono going up the orinoco you see
1320,recently for the first time since ive been commuting to an office again and i realise that id forgotten the most important aspect of the whole business
1321,it starts with getting the train which has been at least minutes late every day except once
1322,but a new trick has been added
1323,at london victoria the underground gets so crowded that a giant yellow light flashes and a siren wails with the sort of noise youd expect to hear if aliens invaded
1324,then a huge metal shutter is drawn across the entrance to stop anyone getting in for up to minutes and a crowd of several hundred builds up
1325,one morning someone lost it as if it was a trench in the first world war and yelled thats it iam going in
1326,and squeezed round the gap to charge through a line of security guards and make a break for it
1327,it felt like the rest of us should shout oh my god tommys cracked and the fool hes going over the top
1328,instead it was more like invasion of the body snatchers with the rest of us thinking donot fight it
1329,be like us and accept it then theres no more pain just a numbness thats quite pleasant once youare used to it
1330,and that way you become a commuter each days journey indistinguishable from the next so that you notice the tiniest differences
1331,aha i thought one day i must be slightly later than yesterday because the busker is at the end of hotel california whereas most days shes only just started
1332,but some things are different from before
1333,to get into this office involves a series of checks guards and airportstyle bag searches that make you wonder whether youve come to an underground military centre to work on a secret spaceship
1334,i saw someone whod worked there years being searched to see if they were carrying any forks because we have to be careful since september
1335,because you canot be sure that a middle manager hasnot been playing a long game slowly getting themselves promoted to reach a position where they could run amok with a fork in revenge for the israeli occupation of the west bank
1336,not only that but in order to repeat the havoc of september this unlikely operative of the berkshire faction of alqaida would need to have perfected the technique of getting offices to fly
1337,besides which inside the building is a huge canteen containing about fifty million forks
1338,once inside nothing can be done without a note or a permit or a laminated card
1339,a memo came round one morning to tell us that today between noon and one oclock you will receive a visit from the internal window cleaner
1340,you start to worry about saying iam just nipping to the toilet in case someone in authority says first youll need to go to the fourth floor and visit the slash department to get your khazi warrant validated
1341,in some ways office work is as classridden as anything from the 19thcentury because its main purpose appears to be to wreck your selfesteem
1342,the worst thing about spending all day being shunted from brokendown train to overcrowded tube to bureaucratic minimetropolis is how it makes you feel utterly worthless
1343,it makes you wonder whether sheep were originally superintelligent creatures who ruled the world but after a few centuries of being herded across fields in groups of several hundred one by one they all gave up and thought oh sod it i might as well stare in a gormless trance until someone mercifully sticks me in a stew
1344,if hell does exist i think it almost certainly contains a corner devoted to pointless discussions
1345,under satanic coercion the damned will be obliged to sit for eternity discussing whether nature is more important than nurture or whether screen violence leads to imitative behaviour
1346,and if youve behaved with particular vileness you will be forced to join the endless debate about the state of the british film industry
1347,quite a few people will be doing this voluntarily this week provoked by the bafta shortlist of nominations for best british film which this year includes some titles that seem to stretch the definition a little
1348,chris columbuss harry potter and robert altmans gosford park are packed with british alist talent but both are directed by americans and financed almost entirely with american money
1349,surely the sceptics will say this is the kind of smashandgrab raid that the best british film category was designed to prevent
1350,the award has always had a smack of the consolation prize as if it were one of those tried jolly hard stickers that the more anxious schools give out on sports day so that slow boys arenot discouraged
1351,but whats the point of cordoning off a section of the trophy table if hollywood can just lean over and rake in the cups
1352,baftas definition of britishness turns out to be pretty straightforward
1353,if you qualify for government tax relief as a british film then you qualify for this section
1354,since the rules are that a film only counts as british if more than per cent of its budget is spent in the united kingdom and more than per cent of the payroll goes to european and commonwealth talent you can see that theres a concept of nationality here that is more allembracing than that generally adopted by the uk immigration service
1355,but baftas approach to this matter strikes me as perfectly sensible or at least properly insouciant about an essentially trivial matter
1356,besides there really isnot a workable alternative
1357,while there might be a popular prejudice in favour of the who pays the piper approach to establishing national pedigree if the americans foot the bill then its an american movie it very quickly runs into trouble
1358,bridget joness diary for instance could credibly be claimed as a french movie by those lights since a large chunk of money came from studio canal
1359,follow the money and you could claim that peter greenaway makes dutch movies and ken loach spanish ones
1360,it doesnot help to call for the travel documents of the producer or director either
1361,is black hawk down a british film simply because ridley scott can walk through the fast track at heathrow passport control
1362,or should a room with a view be regarded as quintessentially indoamerican because its producer ismail merchant comes from bombay and its director james ivory from new york
1363,more importantly who cares apart from the production accountants who must squeeze every last drop out of the smallprint
1364,the truth is that the patrimony of a film amorphous and debatable is probably the least interesting thing about it
1365,cinema has always been a medium that thrived on the genius of immigrants in this country as much as in america
1366,what would hollywood have been without schmuel gelbfisch the young polish boy who later adopted the fabulously aspirational name sam goldwyn
1367,what would british cinema be without korda and pressburger
1368,to those questions we might legitimately add another one
1369,what would american cinema be without the legions of british economic migrants and gastarbeiters who do their time in the hollywood hills
1370,its time to recognise that britishness has been so successfully exported that britons can no longer claim a monopoly on its virtues
1371,of late i have begun cutting my own hair
1372,before this up until a few months ago i would go perhaps twice a month to my barber gino of marchmont street london wc1 to have my hair trimmed by clippers on a no setting with my beard cut slightly longer
1373,however for several years now ginos has been getting more and more popular
1374,i donot know if this has anything to do with a number of extremely attractive women from around the world working there
1375,is it a sort of timid mans lap dancing
1376,i couldnot say
1377,whatever the reason occasionally i would have to wait a long time before i would get to sit in the chair for the few minutes that it would take to have my own sparse bonce done
1378,now i am an extremely busy man a popular and gregarious individual who is surrounded by a large and vibrant family who keep me on the go as they say
1379,the fact that just at this moment i am sitting alone in a dingy basement apartment the dank room lit by a single light bulb on the day after boxing day dining on some stale crackers and able to devote the whole day to writing words to fill in for howard jacobson at a moments notice is merely a statistical anomaly
1380,whatever i felt i didnot have the time to sit around waiting my turn so while i was in spain i purchased a set of electric clippers and set about myself in the bathroom
1381,at first the result was a revelation to me as far as i could see my haircut was as good as i had been getting from the professionals over all these years
1382,my god
1383,i thought to myself ive been squandering seven pounds a month
1384,not to mention all the effort id put in to walking painfully up and down marchmont street leaning on a zimmer frame to qualify for the oap discount now revealed as a terrible waste of time
1385,my doityourself haircut seemed to be a confirmation of an idea that had been at the back of my mind since the time i started losing my hair to malepattern baldness
1386,a bald man like me often harbours resentment about spending money on tonsorial elaboration since it appears an essentially pointless exercise
1387,or sometimes we baldies can go the other way
1388,for example there was a previous editor of this newspaper who was as bereft of hair as i yet who would visit the society trimmer trevor sorbie on average about once a week which knowing the prices that sorbie charges must have worked out at about a hair
1389,so now i thought i was saving myself both time and money
1390,i had a neat haircut while freeing up the time i would have spent at the hair salon to do more important things like download different tones for my mobile from the internet and dribble spittle on the dining room table
1391,yet after a few days something strange happened to my previously uniform haircut and i suspect this is where the skill of the professional hairdresser lies
1392,where there seemed to be an evenly cropped skull there suddenly appeared clumps of ragged hair which i had missed when i had been peering in the mirror along with completely smooth irregularly shaped bald patches which took much longer to grow back than the surrounding hair bloody scars and cuts and long springy cablelike black hairs that sprouted from the dome of my pate
1393,and frankly god knows whats going on behind me
1394,the other day while i was walking past the dalston mosque in east london an angry crowd of worshippers began to form in my wake and a growing mob followed me for quite some distance muttering furious threats and imprecations until i was forced to jump on to a bus
1395,piecing together what they shouted at me afterwards led me to believe that with my clippers and a wobbly hand i may inadvertently have carved various foul obscenities in arabic script onto the back of my skull
1396,in the end i have nobody to blame but myself
1397,i thought that i didnot need anybody else i thought i could do it for myself i was arrogant and vain and as a result i am now forced to go out only at night to slink through the streets of bloomsbury with my hideous visage covered by a long black hooded cloak
1398,also since i have had time to dwell on it though i admit i am perhaps obsessed it strikes me that in the past few months isnot that in a way what the us has been doing cutting its own hair
1399,since september the us has in essence despite the convenient cloak of an alliance been acting on its own unilaterally with no recourse to the collective advice and wisdom of those who know a lot more about the situation than the us does or who will suffer the consequences of the uss actions
1400,at the moment we are in the first days of the new haircut everything looks uniform and smart but in the coming months there is no knowing what strange lumps and excrescences will appear what bald patches or ugly springy hairs will sprout what obscenities will be written
1401,or everything might turn out ok
1402,the fastfood giant mcdonalds was taken to court yesterday by dozens of people who claim to have been scalded by their hot drinks
1403,the victims most of whom are children claim that the cups used by mcdonalds were not suitable and that the tea and coffee was too hot the high court heard
1404,timothy horlock qc representing the group said children were particularly at risk from being scalded with at least claimants aged four or under at the time of the accident
1405,this is not surprising since according to the defendants own statistics per cent of accidents to their customers happen to children under mr horlock said
1406,he said the companys marketing strategy was designed to attract young customers
1407,he said many people did not realise the drinks served at mcdonalds were often far hotter than at home
1408,there was no expectation on the part of the general public that a burn from one of these drinks could result in injuries needing skin grafts mr horlock said
1409,mr horlock told the preliminary hearing that mcdonalds was aware of the danger and was negligent in not taking measures to protect its customers
1410,he said the average temperature of drinks served in mcdonalds machines ranged from 75c to 90c
1411,mcdonalds is contesting the action
1412,in it settled a case with a woman who claimed she suffered serious burns after spilling coffee bought from a mcdonalds in new mexico
1413,she was awarded 29m
1414,2m by a jury which was reduced to on appeal
1415,the hearing continues today
1416,the renaissance in childrens literature is turning out to be one of the most striking cultural characteristics of our times
1417,whether we are reassessing the achievements of the past as with the film of the lord of the rings or falling in love with current childheroes like harry potter there has never been another time when childrens literature could command such attention
1418,about six months ago i wrote on these pages that philip pullmans novel the amber spyglass would be a worthy winner of the booker prize
1419,in the event it didnot make the shortlist but it lived to fight another day
1420,on tuesday night pullman walked away with the whitbread prize
1421,that prize thrives on the neat concept of first dividing books up into categories novel of the year childrens book of the year and so on and then breaking down the categories for its overall prize
1422,that meant that these judges could give the award to philip pullman without being accused of dumbing down to the level of a childrens book
1423,peculiarly this still seems to be a very real fear
1424,although we are currently seeing such an unexpected outpouring of energy in literature for children many commentators are still afraid to admit that these books can stand alongside other literature
1425,novelists such as philip hensher and howard jacobson have mocked the adults who eagerly turn the pages of the harry potter books or even worse queue up to see the film without the excuse of a sevenyearold child by their side
1426,and when peter jacksons film of the lord of the rings was released sceptical critics such as mark lawson thomas sutcliffe and david sexton poured scorn on people who took their childish delights into adulthood
1427,they seem to believe that people who sink into tales that shrug off the adult world are absurd or even a bit dangerous
1428,in one critics words we are proof of the infantilisation of adult culture
1429,but these critics who are proud to be too sophisticated to enjoy a book where a bear talks or a dragon flies might be missing out
1430,they neednot be afraid that they will lose their critical edge if they let down their guard against childish things for an instant
1431,do we still have to spell it out
1432,it really is possible to like rowling and roth to enjoy pullman as well as proust
1433,what is endearing about the new breed of childrens writers is that they are firing a new bolt of energy into literature
1434,nave
1435,yes they may be nave
1436,but what they donot suffer from is the deadening claustrophobia of so much acclaimed literature for grownups
1437,readers who fell on hyped novels such as jonathan franzens the corrections or margaret atwoods the blind assassin only to find them imaginatively underpowered will know what i mean when i say that even the biggest novels today can seem much smaller than life
1438,still perhaps those novels honestly reflect the problematic aspects of our current condition whereas the childrens writers have the liberty of escapism
1439,that may be true
1440,but sometimes it is worth going on these journeys not just to escape but also to return
1441,iam sure iam not alone in saying that after stepping into rowlings world or into pullmans world both of which thrive on the staggeringly precise and sensual detailing of their fantasy universes i found that the everyday world had juddered a little
1442,without doubt they do lack other qualities that you look for in literature that isnot meant for children
1443,but still rowling and pullman can achieve that precious effect on the reader of tearing away the veils of familiarity and reawakening one to the oddness and beauty of ordinary life
1444,and lets not sidestep what is perhaps the most obvious point of these books appeal
1445,as with j k rowling pullman fulfils an often unassuaged longing in this secular age he describes a great battle between good and evil a battle where everything is at stake where you have to take sides
1446,for some people this is just too simple to be enjoyable
1447,they recognise that morality is always about shades of grey and they donot like being seduced into these grand images of deep black and dazzling white
1448,but i find this engagement with ethical themes intriguing
1449,and pullmans moral vision is the most refreshing ive seen in a childrens book for a long time because unlike so many others he does moral fervour without falling into a sub christian message
1450,on the contrary his work contains the most impassioned cry to accept the death of god since nietzsche
1451,no wonder christians have shied away from his books
1452,the amazon website where readers can post opinions contains hundreds of reviews from the united states many of them from parents who call his vision satanic and dark and terrifying and warn other families off them
1453,the same can be heard here
1454,claudia fitzherbert wrote in a newspaper yesterday christian parents beware his books can damage your childs faith
1455,indeed they can
1456,many writers who have tried to preach their atheism in their literature like writers who have tried to preach their religion have ended up weakening their vision
1457,but here the loss of faith is made vivid and energetic
1458,the thrust of the trilogy that is completed by the amber spyglass is to rerun the fall but this time sexuality and knowledge are good and authority is bad
1459,the priests and the church are the embodiment of evil
1460,the aim of the child protagonists is hardly unambitious it is to destroy the dream of the kingdom of heaven and instead to put ones faith in building the republic of heaven in ones own lifetime
1461,isnot this is a great vision for the world after september
1462,here we have a book that asks us to believe that we can build a new highly moral world without the precepts of religion
1463,sure pullman ends up having his cake and eating it
1464,after all a fantasy that includes angels witches embodied souls and the possibility of movement between parallel worlds is hardly a secular universe
1465,this is still a childrens book and it retains comforting childish elements so it can alleviate the dreariness of rationalism with magic flowers and talking bears
1466,nevertheless its fascinating that such a book has found such an audience now
1467,we have all learnt not to ask writers to give us any moral messages
1468,with most literature that works perfectly because it makes us alive to irony and imagination without boxing the work up with moral preconceptions
1469,but pullman is actually asking his readers to engage with him ethically as well as imaginatively
1470,he says wonderfully oldfashioned things like blake once wrote of milton that he was of the devils party without knowing it
1471,i am of the devils party and i know it
1472,pullman celebrates beliefs that should be central to the world we want to build now beliefs in equal sexual love in suspicion of authority in free thought and in a connection with the environment
1473,his sales and reputation suggest that many readers are absolutely entranced by fiction that can mint such brilliant coinage from the dusty moral currency of our age
1474,and even those people who deplore the socalled infantilisation of adult culture would go a long way to find anything else that has such power to make us think and wonder
1475,open a kitchen drawer in any home and they will spring out at you like a jack inthebox
1476,go to any beauty spot and you are sure to encounter a few trapped among the plants like giant insects or flapping noisily in the wind
1477,floating in the local river or blocking your nearest storm drain plastic carrier bags are an unsightly and environmentally degrading fact of modern life
1478,the irish government took action yesterday imposing a tax of cents 9p dubbed the plastax on singleuse plastic shopping bags payable by the shopper not the shop
1479,in britain supermarkets were considering whether the green levy might eventually cross the irish sea
1480,environmentalists meanwhile were estimating how far the annual consumption of billion bags would fall if it did and whether shoppers might change their habits if they had to pay for the environmental consequences of their actions
1481,the notion was given a tentative thumbsup last night by the secretary of state for the environment margaret beckett after a meeting in brussels with her european counterparts
1482,its an interesting idea she said
1483,we are in close touch with our irish colleagues on environmental issues and though its not something we have in mind we will watch the results of the irish initiative with interest
1484,there is no doubt that the irish republic has a problem with plastic bags
1485,the idea of a surcharge on every carrier bag whether given away or sold was first floated in but it has taken until now to implement
1486,even this introduction was delayed from january because the government feared that bringing in such a measure and the euro on the same day would be too much for irelands consumers to cope with
1487,irelands bag tax is expected to raise more than 100m annually which will be channelled into environmental schemes
1488,but bobby malloy the environment minister who first suggested the idea was clear about its aims
1489,he said yesterday the primary purpose of this levy is not to generate revenue but to change consumer behaviour
1490,i want to see a significant reduction in the use of plastic shopping bags and a subsequent reduction in the number of bags that end up as litter
1491,the only exemption in irelands shops and supermarkets are the socalled bags for life sold by many supermarkets for the equivalent of 10p which are replaced for free when they wear out
1492,indeed many irish supermarkets reported a brisk trade in these last weekend
1493,on this side of the irish sea a number of groups are watching developments closely
1494,the environmental group friends of the earth believes it could be significant
1495,foe spokesman mike childs said innovations like this will hopefully focus peoples mind on reusing plastic bags and reduce the amount of unnecessary waste that is so easily created
1496,we will follow its effectiveness with great interest
1497,it might seem obvious that if you charge people for something which they used to get free they will use it less
1498,the same logic underpins the proposals made a week ago by the commission for integrated transport to charge british drivers not for car ownership or petrol use but by road usage based on demand
1499,plastic bags can be recycled but only about
1500,per cent ever are despite schemes such as that operated by sainsburys which gives a 1p refund for every bag that is reused
1501,shredded and compacted they can also be used as bedding for roads and in the construction of buildings
1502,yet plastic bags represent only one part of the complex overall waste problem according to both environmental groups and those who make the bags
1503,at the british plastics federation the watchword is restraint
1504,the bpfs senior adviser on industrial issues marcia gick said a survey in australia found that cigarette butts caused four times more litter than plastic bags
1505,the survey was done by weight
1506,and she added the irish have a very different problem from us in the united kingdom
1507,they have a large rural population and a very bad record on waste collection and disposal
1508,the irish counterpart of the bpf lobbied unsuccessfully of course against the plastax
1509,now the bpf must consider whether it might arrive here although ms gick is quite confident that it will not
1510,the only other european state which taxes plastic bags is denmark which has a tax on all packaging and a similar problem to that of ireland with a big rural population and not enough recycling
1511,and there have been complaints from other european union states that the tax creates a distortion in the market and so is against eu rules
1512,however european states have found a variety of ways to encourage recycling
1513,in belgium supermarkets encourage reuse of their carrier bags by crediting shoppers with points on their loyalty cards
1514,in finland supermarkets pay a levy on the amount of plastic bags used with the proceeds funding recycling
1515,germany has been making advances in recycling for years
1516,in store chains there were ordered to pay a levy to a recycling company in return displaying the gruner punkt green dot on their products
1517,plastic bags have to be bought at the checkout for about 30p though environmentallyfriendly shoppers prefer cloth or wicker bags
1518,the dutch are keen on recycling their carrier bags
1519,they incinerate the bags in accordance with strict environmental rules and use the resulting energy to heat hospitals
1520,other states such as portugal and greece are like ireland laggards in the recycling stakes
1521,for members of the bpf any tax on carrier bags is sure to be bad news
1522,but environmental groups feel that they are absolutely the way to go setting up the way for a radical clash of objectives in the years ahead
1523,in fact for mr childs at friends of the earth taxing plastic bags barely begins to scratch the surface of the problem which in britain is huge but largely hidden from our daily sight just as we tuck those bags away in kitchen cupboards and drawers
1524,the problem is this by according to an eu directive that the uk has agreed to we must only send onethird of our waste to landfill
1525,that means either recycling or incinerating the other twothirds or since landfill space is running out especially in the southeast even more
1526,but incinerators are unpopular at least with the people who have to live near them
1527,so the answer is to recycle
1528,and britons do far too little of that
1529,our fear is that governments put forward ideas for problems which are highprofile but arenot part of a decent waste recycling strategy said mr childs
1530,the irish we hear want to burn all their waste to meet the directive so we think that this plastax is more like a diversion from what needs to be done and from their dirty waste disposal schemes
1531,and if you look at how much it would actually cost to introduce here you would have loads of civil service time taken up with consulting with shops and then drafting legislation and then with chasing shops to see how many plastic bags had been sold
1532,the plastax might actually turn out to be a profitable scheme for unscrupulous shopkeepers which will keep the irish customs excise on its mettle
1533,so what is the real solution
1534,friends of the earth say it is much closer to home than the checkouts ensure that every household has access to a quality doorstep recycling scheme
1535,at present we recycle per cent of our household waste
1536,while that has increased from per cent a few years ago it is still a long way from the per cent needed
1537,without decent recycling facilities people across the uk will continue living next door to polluting incinerators and filthy landfills says mr childs
1538,then you could charge people for the household waste that they donot recycle
1539,that has been introduced in the us and canada and has been very effective in getting people to cut down on their rubbish
1540,it encourages people to think more before they buy stuff with lots of packaging
1541,thats what we really need in this culture
1542,lesley monk a 51yearold from burnley explains to mark mackenzie why she and her team of huskies are going flat out to conquer the wastes of alaska
1543,while you are reading this lesley monk is taking her dogs for a walk
1544,sixteen of them in fact and not just for a quick onceroundthepark
1545,all being well the 51yearold personal trainer from lancashire is now one day into an mile trek across the frozen alaskan wilderness the only british competitor in this years iditarod the most demanding dogsled race on earth
1546,while the winner of an event billed as the last great race in the last great place will be sipping victory champagne in front of a roaring fire inside of days lesley and the other mushers can expect several weeks on the trail which will push them to the limits of their endurance
1547,polar bears fragile riverice and temperatures regularly below 60c are just some of the optional extras on a tour itinerary that requires sleep on the move as well as hours spent massaging weary canine shoulders and feet
1548,the race takes its name from the village of iditarod one of checkpoints along the way as competitors race from anchorage in the east of the state to nome in the west a rerun of an historic journey
1549,in a nome doctor wired anchorage pleading for medicine for an outbreak of diptheria
1550,with no other transport available teams of mushers transported the serum in a dramatic relay across the frozen tundra
1551,the patient was saved and conveniently for the logo writers the legend was born
1552,of which explains how for the third time in years a former hairdresser with a dysfunctional lung finds herself racing some of the hardiest backwoodsmen in north america across their own back yard
1553,lesleys first encounter with a husky alaskas working dog was with one owned by a friend she was visiting in new york in the mideighties
1554,in england we were living on a farm in a highly touristy area she explains on holiday we were greeted by this gentle dog that looked incredibly fierce
1555,deciding huskies were an excellent way to dissuade tourists from wandering up their drive lesley and her husband roy tracked down a breeder in britain
1556,the breeder explained the husky was a working dog and only let me take one away on condition that i worked it
1557,three times a week i would drive to the outskirts of leeds and run the dog with a team behind a cart
1558,the monks obsession with the highly intelligent breed saw their canine family swell to and eventually led them to alaska and via smaller qualifying races to lesleys first iditarod in
1559,i was a total rookie and was pretty overwhelmed by the whole thing she says
1560,i had one absolute dread that id finish last and be out there in the wilderness all on my own
1561,which is precisely what happened
1562,nineteen days after leaving anchorage having struggled to cope with the pace and physical demands of the race lesley crossed the finish line to claim the red lantern the wooden spoon
1563,i was devastated to finish so far back and i loathe talking about getting the red lantern
1564,but with hindsight it was the best thing that could have happened because now on the trail there are very few things that phase me
1565,her disappointment over her placing emphasises the fiercely competitive nature of the event
1566,lesleys next outing was in when she was forced to scratch after her sled and team went through thin ice attempting a river crossing
1567,the water was only thigh deep but my sled sank and the dogs were in the water getting tangled up in their gang lines
1568,the problem was compounded by the following teams who were jumping over us to get across and were getting tangled themselves
1569,while lesley insists there is camaraderie between the mushers competitors will only come to anothers aid if a situation is lifethreatening
1570,given that leading racers have also been known to confuse the chasing pack by removing trail markers as they pass this clearly isnot the london marathon
1571,but then in prize money is a hefty sum in outback alaska
1572,and bearing in mind that only four of this years field are of alaskan descent it seems is a lot money everywhere else
1573,the iditarod was first raced competitively in when it was won by dick wilmarth in days
1574,around a dozen dogs died through exhaustion the result of poor nutrition
1575,races since have had huge teams of vets and the death rate has fallen to below four dogs per thousand
1576,while the humane society of the us have been trying to get the race banned for many years race vets rightly contend that the death rate is about equal to that in a sedentary canine population
1577,and animal welfare has certainly progressed from centuries past when native alaskans tethered husky bitches in woodland to mate with local wolves
1578,if the wolf chose to mate with rather than eat his blind date the outcome would be a litter of working dogs with a wild toughness
1579,all the attention is focused on the dogs and nobody really cares about you lesley explains
1580,the rules state that the sled must have the capacity to carry an injured dog under cover as well as demanding one compulsory 24hour rest and two eighthour breaks at checkpoints
1581,these are on top of the camp breaks we take out on the trail
1582,people who donot know these animals have no idea what they are capable of
1583,their speed and stamina are breathtaking and if you get the right balance of personalities in your team you can really fly
1584,while the demands on the dogs are immense the demands on the mushers are equally daunting
1585,if the team is down for eight hours the dogs are resting but youare constantly working rubbing ointment into cuts on feet massaging joints preparing food says lesley
1586,when you set off youare exhausted and the dogs want to run like the wind
1587,and the treats in store back on the trail are many
1588,mushers need tremendous aerobic fitness to be able to scoot skateboard style with one leg on the sled for long distances
1589,should conditions become sticky scooting turns to oldfashioned running to maintain the most prized weapon in the mushers armoury momentum
1590,standing still for extended periods also places tremendous strain on the arms and back and should you take your eye off the trail at the wrong moment you could wind up with a smack in the chops from an overhanging branch
1591,and unless your screams carry across miles of wilderness youare in trouble
1592,yet despite the hazards lesley is undaunted
1593,i keep going back because i love it she says
1594,shopping sure but culture
1595,can this gulf state offer anything other than golf courses and gold souks
1596,wake up to a different view
1597,it is early in the morning
1598,i look out of the window and see below me the clear calm turquoise waters of the gulf
1599,above me the sky is already pale blue
1600,between the turquoise and the pale blue a haze of mother of pearl wreaths the city that stretches out from the shore in the pale silky colours of an expensive negligee
1601,the spires and towers of dubais astonishing architecture stretch up out of the mist like some fantastic palace from the arabian nights
1602,even what i later discover is an industrial installation looks like a fairytale fortress in this light
1603,its difficult to believe that it wonot melt away like a mirage or a vision
1604,vision
1605,its a key word here
1606,modern dubai exists you will be told thanks to the vision of sheikh rashid bin saeed al maktoum the father of the present ruler sheikh maktoum
1607,his farsightedness created a gulf state that is no longer dependent on the profits from oil but is a world centre of business and trade
1608,dubais visions come on a grand scale and they take physical shape with remarkable speed
1609,you want two manmade islands shaped like palm trees each with miles of coastline housing hotels luxury villas etc etc etc
1610,construction begins next year
1611,you want to turn a shopping mall into an entire city complete with parks childrens playgrounds hotels and apartments
1612,consider it done
1613,my vantage point for this dawn view of the city is a metre feet high hotel shaped like a boat and looking like a spinnaker
1614,it rises from the sea on a manmade island while a second hotel shaped like a cresting silver breaker lies like a bow wave beneath it
1615,this is the sevenstar burj al arab
1616,completed only three years ago it is already an icon
1617,it deserves iconic status i think
1618,its a beautiful building almost organic in feel once you are inside with its layers of floors rising up tier upon tier like the interior of a beehive or a strange seed pod
1619,at the top is what looks from a distance like a glass envelope the al muntaha restaurant with its stunning views across the gulf while below the hotel accessed by a submarine ride lift is the al mahara seafood restaurant whose walls encase vast aquaria
1620,to say that the interior of the burj is lavishly exotic is like saying that coco chanel designed the odd suit
1621,it is quite startlingly luxurious
1622,there are no rooms only suites of which mine was a very lowly variety
1623,it was about as big as my edwardian terraced house just a onebedroom suite you understand
1624,the bathroom toiletries are herms and you get given bottles and bottles of the stuff
1625,you can tell whos been staying at the burj they trail around in a cloud of faubourg
1626,everything is done by remote control including summoning the butler
1627,ours was called francis and he carefully explained how to use the interactive controls to open and close the curtains and so on
1628,of course i forgot all this the minute he left the room and spent about half an hour trying to open the livingroom curtains
1629,eventually i retired upstairs to bed to find that id opened the bedroom curtains instead
1630,the bedroom was so far away up an impressive curved marble staircase past a gigantic chandelier that i couldnot hear the hum of the mechanism
1631,the burj was a fabulous experience
1632,iam ashamed to say that i felt a tiny twinge of guilty relief when i transferred to the jumeirah beach hotel
1633,this is the one that looks like a cresting silver wave and its a very jolly place full of very jolly families doing very jolly beach holiday things
1634,the beach waiters even offer to clean your sunglasses for you and there is not a lager lout within miles
1635,as for the curtains they are operated by the usual pulley mechanism
1636,bliss
1637,it is early in the morning
1638,the sun is rising vast and red through the murk of an incipient sandstorm
1639,iam on my way to the oasis stables near the nad al sheba racecourse
1640,suddenly on the outskirts of this city of gold i see the ancient currency of arabia making its majestic way across the sands
1641,camels
1642,scores of them some ridden by tiny boys are heading for the camel racetrack a circuit so vast i cannot see the other side or even each end
1643,when the race is in progress the spectators have to follow it in a flotilla of fourwheel drives
1644,we halt as the camel caravans cross the road ahead with that distinctive swaying camel gait
1645,but if these are the sultans of swing the thoroughbreds at oasis are the sheikhs of the sport of kings aristocrats whose bloodlines are as ancient as their owners
1646,the oasis stables are part of the godolphin racing empire owned by the maktoum brothers sheikh rashids sons
1647,sheikh mohammed bin rashid almaktoum is the prime mover in the enterprise making history in the nineties by overwintering his britishbred horses in dubai and winning a string of classic victories
1648,we are shown around the stables by trainer nick robb
1649,nick is a world expert on racehorses but if he ever decided on an alternative career he would make a good living as a tour guide
1650,hes a natural
1651,his audience is rapt as he outlines the science that goes into making a horse run from a to b in the fastest possible time
1652,at the end of the stables tour we are taken to the racetrack to see the grandstand and tour the jockeys quarters and the stewards room
1653,this is where the dubai world cup the worlds richest horse race will be run on march
1654,entry to race meetings is free and theres no gambling
1655,but who needs a bet when you can watch the result of centuries of arab equine expertise come thundering down the track
1656,it is early in the morning
1657,a falcon hangs in the sky high above the desert before stooping in a heartstopping dive for its reward
1658,here and there arabian oryx nibble the shrubby plants that form defiant grey mats in the sand
1659,i bend down and rub the leaves between my fingers
1660,to my english gardening hands they feel bereft of any moisture or goodness
1661,but mitch our south african field guide assures me that the oryx thrive on their diet and points to where tiny yellow flowers have bloomed a response to a shortlived shower the night before
1662,falconry is an arab tradition the birds are pictured on the dubai currency the dirham
1663,in his book arabian sands about oman and the empty quarter the explorer wilfred thesiger describes hunting bustard with peregrine falcons on camelback accompanied by a pack of salukis
1664,he tells how an arab falconer could have a bird ready to hunt in a fortnight to three weeks
1665,at the al maha they have both peregrine and saker falcons and the birds are fed on quail bought from the supermarket
1666,the guests donot really want to see things being killed mitch says drily
1667,al maha means oryx and the resort is another vision made reality
1668,set in square miles of desert nature reserve it is designed to resemble a bedouin encampment
1669,even the oryx have appeared as if by the wave of a wand reintroduced after being hunted to extinction
1670,thesiger doesnot like the term bedouin he says its a double plural and the correct term is bedu
1671,he and his bedu of course accounted for quite a few oryx
1672,the general manager tony williams is a south african ecologist who believes refreshingly that the secret of running a successful hotel is good manners
1673,you should treat people as if they were a guest in your house he says
1674,each guest chalet is arranged to give maximum privacy with its own deck and plunge pool
1675,the interiors are luxurious but they are as understated as the burj al arab is spectacular
1676,theres no harrodsonecstasy glitz here but a wooden easel in the corner complete with paper and pastels
1677,it would be wrong to imply that you donot receive a warm welcome elsewhere in dubai
1678,at all the hotels regardless of their architectural idiosyncrasies there is smiling courtesy
1679,even in the emirates towers hotel a tall sharp pencil of a building that seems to encapsulate in glass and steel dubais gogetting onwardthrusting character the service is unfailingly friendly
1680,however and iam sorry to labour the arabian nights analogy there is something magical about the al maha
1681,it has something to do with the pace of life the change of focus
1682,apparently many people come here for only one or two nights
1683,i was told before i came that i wouldnot want to spend more than a night as there is nothing to do
1684,i easily could have spent a week at al maha
1685,hell i could have spent a year
1686,before dinner i sat on the terrace and watched dusk fall over the desert
1687,the dry fragrance of frankincense from an incense burner nearby lingered on the warm still night air
1688,if only herms could capture that and put it in a bottle
1689,at present i am trying to write my first serious novel a process that seems to involve endless displacement activity and i find that if i switch the bill on at 9am on uk gold i am all too likely to be still watching hours later as the schedule swings its way through hospital emergency rooms and australian soaps that would have sent me screaming from the room when they were first screened but that now exert a compelling amust see what happens next force on me
1690,if you watch too much daytime television you soon become aware that the commercials in the advertising breaks are aimed very much at people who to say the least are likely to have trouble with their finances
1691,there are ads for personalinjury lawyers encouraging various mugwumps to try and claim compo for accidents that theyve supposedly had
1692,there are loads of companies offering loans encouraging other mugwumps to borrow huge sums of money to buy essential items like conservatory extensions for their 10thfloor council flats or their own rocket or trampoline lessons for their cat
1693,another type of ad aimed at the financially challenged is for firms with names such as yes car credit which offer to provide newish cars for people who absolutely nobody else will sell cars to and lets face it car salesmen are not really that choosy theres one interesting feature of these particular commercials all the blokes in them have big fat wives i guess that they know their market and the only fantasy aspect is connected with the cars
1694,and finally in every break there are several adverts from companies with names such as baines ernst that offer to combine all the debts that youve acquired from making stupid purchases paying way too much for a treg vauxhall astra and trying to sue gravity for making you fall over into one single loan that you owe them rather than your several hundred creditors
1695,however an interesting sideline that these companies provide is that they also offer to combine all your moral debts into one big moral debt that you owe them
1696,so now i have to drive baines and ernst to the airport every week i have to clean their carpet and i must never ever look at another woman except baines and ernst
1697,i also have to apologise to them for stopping this column for a while
1698,while doing press promotion for my new collection of short stories which was released in august i would tell journalists interviewing me that with my first collection of stories barcelona plates selling over copies and this new one the dog catcher doing over in hardback in six weeks i was the most successful shortstory writer in britain since the war
1699,now amazingly it turns out that this might actually be true
1700,i never expected that
1701,of course the fact is that these numbers that i have been bragging about would be considered totally piddling in any other field of the media that ive been involved in but in publishing these numbers denote a major smash hit partly because very few people buy collections of short stories
1702,i think i have finally found the artistic field that i should be in a field where tiny numbers still denote huge success where the minuscule number of twisted supercilious malcontents who find me funny can make a gigantic difference to the percentages of sales figures
1703,once i might have sneered at this but my sense now which has been arrived at over years of an upanddown showbusiness career is that success is success and whatever denotes success makes you feel much better and if you are feeling good about yourself that feeling is reflected in numerous ways
1704,i remember years ago that i visited a restaurant in covent garden with lenny henry
1705,we had just done a tv show together called ott which had caused a big furore and had been a disaster so big that id returned from birmingham where the show was made with somebody elses tail between my legs
1706,this restaurant we went to made a big deal of its visitors book which they nagged me into signing
1707,a few years later i happened to revisit this place at a time when i had my own hit television series and was feeling on top of the world with a string of awards and massive viewing figures
1708,flipping back through the pages of the restaurants visitors book i was able to compare my signatures then and now
1709,looking back at the first it was tiny crabbed tentative and spidery reflecting my feeble doubting inner state while my second autograph was bold and flowing taking up half a page obviously full of confidence and selfbelief
1710,also for some reason on my first visit to the restaurant i had been calling myself les dennis
1711,i donot know why
1712,anyway because i am such a big hit as an author i will be leaving this column for a while to try and write that bookerlosing novel
1713,i think its a good time to leave newspaper writing for a while its not like theres anything much going on in the world to write about
1714,sometimes you really have to scratch your head a bit
1715,the economic data have signalled generally upbeat news
1716,industrial surveys are consistently pointing to recovery even if actual growth in the second half of was rather disappointing
1717,yet the financial markets remain very sceptical with equities lower relative to the end of last year
1718,meanwhile messrs greenspan and george are prepared only to be cautiously optimistic
1719,yes the worst may now be behind us
1720,but no there can be no guarantees of a rapid return to buoyant and perhaps more importantly sustainable economic growth
1721,what should we make of these cross currents
1722,there are one or two reasonably straightforward conclusions
1723,first its pretty clear even with a recovery there is no immediate risk of a return to higher interest rates
1724,if there are doubts about the sustainability of economic growth it would be a bit odd to take the risk of raising interest rates only to be blamed for creating a subsequent doubledip
1725,kneejerk financial market reactions that point to higher interest rates at the first sign of recovery should therefore be dismissed
1726,second if the recovery is ultimately constrained the inflationary outlook should be subdued for a prolonged period of time
1727,indeed to the extent that activity levels remain below where they should be either because unemployment is too high or because theres plenty of spare capacity theres a good chance that inflation may undershoot central bank targets
1728,this leads to some interesting results
1729,at the bank of england for example the corridors are still echoing more to the sound of cooing doves than screeching hawks
1730,underneath all of this however is an issue about recession and recovery
1731,if the recession is shallow what does this say about the subsequent recovery
1732,this is a key question for policy makers today
1733,the downswing through the course of proved to be relatively mild
1734,indeed as alan greenspan said in his testimony before congress last week the recuperative powers of the us economy
1735,have been remarkable
1736,clearly mr greenspan is hopeful that the worst is now over and certainly from a data perspective there has been plenty of good news recently
1737,yet he is never one to have his cake and eat it
1738,although the economy did not perform as badly as feared in the second half of last year the us federal reserve chairman was quick to emphasise that an array of influences unique to this business cycle
1739,seems likely to moderate the speed of the anticipated recovery
1740,of course these words simply emphasise that mr greenspan is a master of the on the one hand on the other hand approach beloved of so many economists
1741,nevertheless he has good reasons to remain concerned about the mediumterm outlook irrespective of the recent signs of economic improvement
1742,heres a little story for you
1743,a country has just been through a prolonged boom in economic activity
1744,asset prices have risen rapidly far outstripping gains in indebtedness either for consumers or for companies
1745,the asset price bubble eventually bursts
1746,there are fears of a collapse in economic activity yet initially these fears prove to be unfounded
1747,certainly growth slows down but unlike other countries there is no significant contraction in economic activity
1748,indeed on the socalled technical definition two successive quarters of declining gdp recession is avoided
1749,meanwhile although asset prices come down sharply consumers continue to spend rather than save
1750,now youare probably thinking that this is the us story over the past year or so and of course youd be absolutely right
1751,consumers have carried on spending
1752,the economy has held up better than expected continuing to outperform the likes of germany and japan and for that matter the uk in the final quarter of last year
1753,and the dollar has remained strong suggesting an international vote of confidence in all things american
1754,unfortunately however exactly the same observations could have been made about japan at the beginning of the 1990s
1755,the japanese bubble burst at the end of
1756,equity prices began their relentless decline followed by land prices a year and a half later
1757,the initial weakness in asset prices didnot seem to do too much damage
1758,true the economy began to slow down relative to the stellar performance seen at the end of the 1980s
1759,however relative to the performance of other countries japan continued to do well
1760,in japan saw
1761,per cent growth compared with
1762,per cent in the us and
1763,per cent in the uk
1764,in growth in japan slowed to
1765,per cent but in the same year gdp fell
1766,per cent in the us and by
1767,per cent in the uk
1768,meanwhile the yen began a steady appreciation
1769,i would not want to suggest that the us is about to go down japans path
1770,there are lots of differences in economic structure in the desire for profit in the flexibility of the workforce in the pace of productivity growth
1771,these imply that america is a lot better placed to deal with the consequences of a sustained decline in asset prices
1772,nevertheless japans experience does suggest that we should be careful in concluding too much from the initial stages of a decline in asset prices
1773,the us may still be outperforming the rest of the world for the time being
1774,but can we really be sure that this story will continue in the years ahead
1775,this question boils down to an issue about imbalances factors that might constrain the ability of an economy to grow over the medium term
1776,one way to think about this is to regard recession as unpleasant cleansing experiences a bit like taking a cold shower with a lump of carbolic soap
1777,the process might not be very pleasant but at least you come out more hygienic if not smelling of roses
1778,has the us been through this cleansing experience
1779,to date the answer is probably no
1780,the current account deficit is large and is likely to increase even further in the short term if the economy continues to rebound
1781,consumers have yet to increase their savings even with a major decline in asset values
1782,profits have seen the biggest decline in the postwar period and to date have shown no transparent signs of a rebound indeed transparency and profits have not exactly been obvious bedfellows recently
1783,basically we are not out of the woods yet
1784,if anything financial market indicators are pointing to more signs of distress
1785,risky assets like equities have fallen in value relative to safer investments like government bonds and cash
1786,banks continue to limit lending to the corporate sector
1787,the commercial paper market has dried up
1788,these factors all suggest that the current recovery may fade later in the year
1789,the feds shot in the arm last year may have given the us economy enough strength for a short sprint forward but americas reputation as a long distance runner may be fading
1790,pain de campagne sourdoughs baguettes ciabatta and exotic loaves incorporating everything from carrot to olives spinach to sundried tomato
1791,the supermarkets bakery shelves are chockablock and judging by the mindboggling variety on offer real bread seems to be enjoying a massive revival in britain
1792,but has good traditionally made bread really made a comeback
1793,the suggestion prompts tom jaine former editor of the good food guide and author of making bread at home cassell
1794,to froth like overyeasted dough
1795,most of the bread that masquerades as real isnot real at all
1796,in a tiny way it is different from the supermarket bread of years ago but its no better
1797,ive just eaten a sunflowerseed loaf from duchy originals that was every bit as nasty as massproduced bread
1798,supermarket sourdoughs made ostensibly with natural leavens are as insubstantial and characterless as the ones they used to make with yeast
1799,jaine insists that the move to real bread is actually restricted to a minute proportion of the london middle class
1800,certainly a fine crop of good bread shops has appeared in the capital in the past few years mainly in the posher postal districts
1801,the haute couture pinnacle of real bread is represented by poilne
1802,the signature bread produced from the woodfired stoves of its belgravia bakery the only poilne outlet outside paris is a tremendous sourdough loaf of close texture and wonderful complex flavour
1803,this bread is famously the favourite crust of de niro bacall and deneuve but donot let that put you off or the fact that a loaf costs around
1804,weighing the best part of 2kg it will last most families for a week or more
1805,another welcome french newcomer is the paul bakery in covent garden the first english branch of a chain with outlets in france
1806,the baker spice bakery in south kensington produces equally superb bread which can also be bought at branches of konditor cook
1807,if you see their san francisco sourdough or potatoand rosemary bread snap it up before someone else does
1808,the three branches of de gustibus sell fine breads
1809,black forest rye and roasted onion rye are particularly worth seeking out
1810,londons latest and coolest are the two exeter street bakery shops in kensington and covent garden selling italian breads and pizzas perfected by the restaurateur who brought joe allen over here
1811,then theres the branches of maison blanc
1812,but where does this leave real bread addicts who live outside london
1813,sainsburys claims to be making the right stuff
1814,as part of its taste the difference range twothirds of sainsburys stores now stock a range of speciality breads
1815,not a bad effort you think at first
1816,the french country loaf certainly looks the part but the crust was too thin and the crumb was too opentextured
1817,worse still it was so salty that we ended up throwing it out
1818,sainsburys raisinandrosemary loaf is vast for
1819,but the raisins proved to be few and far between
1820,a seedandhoney loaf was ok for toasting
1821,one grain of comfort for nonmetropolitan loaflovers is mail order
1822,the village bakery will ship from its cumbrian ovens any order for a flat rate of
1823,you can choose from breads all baked in a wood fired oven including a naturalleaven campagne and a russian sourdough called rossisky
1824,now the bbc has embraced narrowcasting with its new channels boyd tonkin asks if tv will ever again surprise us with the unexpected
1825,on saturday the bbcs new cultural channel finally shed the dowdy chrysalis of knowledge to emerge as a gaudy butterfly known as four
1826,not all of us can stick around to watch the metamorphosis
1827,after a first night of joint transmission with bbc fours six hours per day of arts ideas and reportage has reverted to the digital platforms still closed to the half of british households who can only receive terrestrial fare
1828,roly keating the corporations doyen of arts who became fours first controller in the new year will be hoping to make his mark in a blaze of light glory
1829,for the bbc a lot rides on the reception of four
1830,greg dyke and his satraps gaze nervously towards the expiry of their current charter in
1831,the longplanned national switchover from analogue to digital television sets proceeds at more of a crawl than a gallop
1832,to put it bluntly four not only has to recruit a loyal core of arts addicts and documentary demons it must also help to persuade opinionshifters in politics and the media that the bbc licence fee remains the only defensible form of polltax in years of british history
1833,four has won over downing street without too much of a battle
1834,the culture secretary tessa jowell greenlighted it last autumn along with the bbcs two digital childrens channels
1835,however backstage ructions from commercial competitors have delayed approval for the corporations revamped youth service bbc three
1836,its no secret that the beebs rivals above all rupert murdoch keenly resent the spectacle of licencefunded empirebuilding a dozen years after the advent of sky it seems to presage the secular decline of publicservice broadcasting
1837,with a clever touch of bathos four slid down the slipway at the weekend not with some operatic blockbuster but a dadaist squib a film about the artist michael landy who trashed his possessions in the window of a defunct west end store
1838,it bore the title the man who destroyed everything
1839,as far as the bbc goes rupert murdoch would wish for no other epitaph
1840,the details of four so far announced show why he should never get his way
1841,to be sure some merely fill the glaring holes left by the makeover of bbc into a cookeryandcomedy location for 35yearolds a weekly books programme the readers and writers roadshow for instance or the reliably leftfield storyville documentary strand and an 8pm news slot with a global remit
1842,other promised delights keep up the grand tradition of gala television peter brooks hamlet from paris romanian diva angela gheorghiu in concert or the africa now music festival staged in a soccer stadium in senegal
1843,yet we already have artsworld and performance channels to do the firstnight folderol
1844,behind the handsome limbs four hopes to offer a skeleton of inquiry and debate in features such as the ideasdriven talk show with andrew marr
1845,lets hope that such regular articulations allow the channel to act more like a coherent creature than a frankensteins monster of scavenged artparts
1846,as it happens mary shelleys stroke of inspiration on the shores of lake geneva has loomed large in the publicity for four
1847,frequent trailers have deployed the notion of the genius loci to label the new outfit as a place to think
1848,all the hype agrees that this must be a special location satisfyingly different from mainstream tv a haven for seekers and mavericks
1849,now who apart from mr murdoch could possibly object to that
1850,well you can welcome the channels content while still lamenting the drift towards segmentation and fragmentation that its coming represents
1851,these days we are all the playthings of demography our tastes ticketed and bracketed by media puppetmasters who long to give us exactly what they know we want and nothing less or more
1852,niche culture permits providers to deliver targeted audiences to advertisers with enough exactitude to make sure that a twentysomething urban clubber seldom has to contemplate an ad for a diy greenhouse or a stairlift
1853,filterers and packagers devote their time and skill to guaranteeing that we never run across any item that surprises or intrigues us
1854,if it didnot sound too much like the sort of pompous restoration tragedy that not even four would deign to broadcast you might call this trend the death of serendipity
1855,of course the bbc has no fickle advertisers to please just fickle politicians
1856,so it doesnot need to play the demographic game of divideandlure in quite so crude a fashion
1857,the chief constituency of four ought to consist of selfselecting minorities convened by a passion whether for qawwali music or quantum theory rather than by the brute parameters of region age or class
1858,always remember that a large majority of affluent folk take their leisure in entirely populist forms last week we learned that a third of chelsea ticketholders earn more than per year
1859,meanwhile keating and colleagues vow that bbc in particular will not treat the birth of four as a pretext for an even deeper plunge into gardeningandgameshow territory
1860,we shall see
1861,in narrowcasting ventures such as four theres a paradox at work that deserves more attention than it gets
1862,since the sixties many of the most exciting pulses of innovation across a spread of cultural forms have come from a push towards fusion and hybridity
1863,creatively confused artists have sought to abolish the distance between lite and popular styles highbrow and lowbrow registers learned and vernacular traditions
1864,look at some of bbc fours early performance slots and youll spot this force in progress bjrk sings at covent garden fidelio comes live from a birmingham big top an opera company mounts a successful search for new divas in the townships of south africa
1865,tune in to the liveliest american tv so often the benchmark for canny british broadcasters and this pattern stares you in the face
1866,buffy the vampire slayer samples years of gothic visual and literary style and places a selfconscious embodiment of european high culture giles at its heart seinfeld stages his deadpan freeform postmodern jests the simpsons import the dynamics of eugene oneill and arthur miller into the animated comicstrip
1867,yet while makers of culture everywhere cross boundaries and blur distinctions its marketers labour to reinforce them
1868,audiences are sliced and sorted into ever thinner bands
1869,with the birth of cbeebies even the underfives have their own channel
1870,internetproviders track your path through the web in order to deliver the sites your record shows or seems to show you want
1871,newspapers dream of delivering the online daily me preedited according to your preferences
1872,a smart box called the tivo will not merely record favourite tv shows but when it knows you well enough anticipate your viewing choice as well
1873,even in the reliably behindthebeat book trade publishers and retailers flog their wares under the unvarying rubric if you liked x youll love y
1874,but my haphazard education in the arts like millions of others came about because i stumbled without signposts across z and decided i should spend more time in that place
1875,serendipity the book picked up by accident the film at first watched reluctantly the magical snatch of music overheard can shape the lifelong experience of those blessed with such happy accidents
1876,for a brief period so one broadcasting fable goes the singlechannel bbc tv embodied this ideal of diversityinunity
1877,plenty of veterans recall it as history while many younger programmemakers dismiss it as pure myth
1878,one evening sometime in the early sixties according to this story the loyal bbcwatcher might have grazed through an arts magazine some serious current affairs a gritty commissioned drama half an hour of classic tony hancock comedy a satirical blast of that was the week that was and if they were especially lucky the sight of a j p taylor explaining the origins of the great war with only a bowtie for special effects
1879,todays brash moguls of reality tv notably peter bazalgette mock this memory as a nostalgic fabrication
1880,they point out with some justice that bbc tv in its golden age was where the decrepit remnants of british musichall went to die in agony for the viewers
1881,yet as william blake wrote a truth thats told with bad intent beats all the lies you can invent
1882,the bazalgettes grow fat on fragmentation
1883,they donot want to see a truly varied tv schedule in operation again
1884,so they deny that it ever existed
1885,in their perspective only the big brothers weakest links and pop idols can be allowed the primetime honour of shaping the national chat
1886,how soon before will young looks old
1887,on the other hand puccini and pavarotti still live in the affections of millions because some inspired producer trampled the barriers and decided to fanfare italia with nessun dorma
1888,serendipity needs a little shove at times
1889,and the bbc brass need to recall that one of their real triumphs in the past decade has been a bitsandbobs radio station that flourished despite or perhaps because of a higgledypiggledy brief five live
1890,what will the bbc team choose for this summers transmissions from japan and south korea
1891,madame butterfly might sound a trifle too corny
1892,still some of us can hope that one fine day a television vessel freighted with a richly varied cargo will sail back into the harbour of our lives
1893,motorists who have just passed their driving test may be subject to tougher drinkdrive and speeding laws under plans being considered by the government
1894,lower bloodalcohol levels and reduced speed limits were two of possible options in a consultation paper about novice drivers published yesterday
1895,other options for new drivers include restrictions on nighttime driving making them drive smallerengined vehicles and the compulsory display of p provisional plates for six or months after passing the test
1896,compulsory professional tuition for learners and accompanying drivers skid and motorway training and the introduction of a probationary licence code for the first two years are also being considered
1897,andrew howard the aas head of road safety policy welcomed the paper but added some of the suggestions in the consultation paper are impractical and unenforceable
1898,the aa believes the introduction of p plates would do little to improve safety and it warns that limiting the time when young drivers may drive is likely to be impractical
1899,so long bricks and mortar
1900,cheaper greener options are available
1901,little boxes made of ticky tacky
1902,it may have been a good refrain and a fair indictment of a nations love of bricks and mortar but todays house builders are challenging the stereotype by using more inventive materials and building methods at both ends of the eco spectrum
1903,bellway homes is nearing completion on the hamsterley a georgianstyle polystyrene kit house which john watson their chief executive describes as a glamorous prefab that is here to stay
1904,he adds we like to explore new technologies
1905,this is a potential revolution in british housing and in building this house the first of its kind in the country we are demonstrating the possibilities from this unique design through to delivery
1906,the fivebedroom property is the first traditional look factorybuilt sectional house made of polystyrene and steel for sale in the uk
1907,its lightweight steel frame clad externally with light but extremely strong insulating panels makes it highly energyefficient
1908,the polystyrene house may have an sap standard assessment procedures rating of per cent but some builders prefer greener materials
1909,richard scales and ralph carpenter of modece architects worked on a hemp house in haverhill suffolk and have mixed views on the use of polystyrene
1910,mr scales says there are some benefits because its energy efficient but its not green
1911,its using material derived from oil which is unsustainable because fossil fuel will one day run out
1912,the material used to create the hemp house will never run out if the project takes off
1913,ralph carpenters inspiration came from a visit to france where he first saw hemp being used in construction
1914,he convinced suffolk housing society and st edmundsbury council to lead a trial to discover whether hemp is a suitable building material
1915,the hemp houses have been built beside traditional brickandblock constructions and insulation soundproofing structural ability resistance to moisture and condensation will be monitored to make comparisons
1916,encouragingly for architects such as mr scales largescale developers are interested in the hemp house but he accepts the use of greener materials on a mass scale may take time
1917,most of the industry is locked into bricks and blocks because thats the way their operatives are used to working and understand
1918,if you start using different materials then that jacks the price up as they canot do it without thinking which seems to cost more
1919,ultimately the hemp project may revive a crop that used to be grown extensively in britain but it should be pointed out that unlike its notorious cousin hemp used in construction has no hallucinatory qualities
1920,steve clarke suffolk housing societys chief executive says we are hoping that it will make a significant contribution to finding a more environmentally friendly way to create new homes
1921,at present innovative building projects inevitably cost more than traditional methods but this may change
1922,initially the hemp house was considered expensive although it may prove cheaper in the long term
1923,one building in north london has proved it is possible to produce a costeffective construction that is also sustainable
1924,number stock orchard street designed by sarah wigglesworth architects is partly built with straw bales
1925,architects sarah wigglesworth and jeremy till who live and work in the house say the building pays attention as we believe every building should to issues of environment
1926,materials are chosen for their low embodied energy straw bales recycled concrete and sandbags
1927,the strawbale house is a good example of research by design in a project featuring the first approved use of this material in the uk although there is a growing strawbale movement in the us and its benefits are many
1928,straw costs 150p
1929,per bale delivered to central london is widely available easy to build with and provides good thermal insulation because it breathes
1930,the architects installed the bales with friends and family
1931,standard practice is to render the bales on both sides but here the architects have clad the building on the outside with a rain screen
1932,having ensured the walls are carefully detailed to keep out vermin and water both things that would otherwise lead to a short life they add
1933,the tension between the roughness of the bales and the sleek exterior of the clingfilm sheathing disturbs the normal architectural categories uniting the slick with the hairy
1934,you donot actually need computers for special effects as the bafta award ceremony demonstrated on sunday evening
1935,as the stars arrived an unforeseen combination of household chemicals and the worst of english weather added a mildly uncanny detail to the clichs of photographers flashes and red carpet
1936,a sebaceous slime appeared beneath the feet of the celebrities a copious froth which seemed like a manifestation of some otherwise intangible presence a kind of miasma of ego perhaps
1937,i canot have been alone though in thinking how much more powerful the scene would have been with a bit of postproduction cgi work
1938,you can easily imagine a stephen king rationale
1939,a red carpet haunted by the spirit of a murdered extra decides that it isnot going to let the stars walk all over it anymore and as the more pernicious characters beam and smirk their way into the ceremony a malevolent ectoplasm swirls towards them across the surface oozing upwards over the manolo blahniks and versace dresses to vandalise their glamour
1940,the effect might even win an award given the current popularity of this kind of visual excess
1941,certainly the lavish digital effects in lord of the rings canot have done that film any harm when it came to handing out the prizes since without computergenerated imagery or ggi for short it would barely have been conceivable as a project
1942,altogether there were something like specialeffect shots in lord of the rings overlapped so that it was often impossible to tell where real objects stopped and the purely virtual ones began
1943,there
1944,are purists who find this depressing an indication that the long cinematic standoff between the lumire school dedicated to the ethical superiority of unmediated photography and the followers of mlis equally passionate about films ability to play with time and space like putty has finally been settled in favour of fantasy
1945,for such people digital effects are the cinematic equivalent of genetically modified foods and the only way for them to guarantee the purity of their diet these days is to go comprehensively organic refusing to consume anything unless it has come from markets too poor to afford technological adulteration
1946,anything from mali or iran can usually be counted as safe
1947,in one respect the cassandras are right
1948,the intermingling of real and computer generated is now so sophisticated that it descends to the level of individual particles
1949,in the film pearl harbor for example real smoke and its computergenerated equivalent were often used in combination to achieve the required effect
1950,elsewhere computer effects are preferred to the real thing because of their biddability
1951,in black hawk down there was no difficulty in achieving the dust clouds caused by helicopter rotor wash but it tended to inconvenience the actors so the ground was dampened before filming and the areal effect added later
1952,the result of course was realism which from the very beginning of cinema has always been a highly artificial substance
1953,but when it comes to the suggestion that cgi may be fundamentally toxic to the cinematic enterprise its enemies are on weaker ground
1954,true it is currently an overused technology prone to distract its devotees from humble virtues such as narrative coherence and psychological plausibility
1955,reviewing vidocq the first film to be made entirely with digital cameras the hollywood reporter offered what has become a fairly familiar coupling
1956,it was it declared visually stunning and stunningly inane a judgement which you might do well to keep on hand for the release of the next star wars movie shot on digital cameras in three months followed by months of postproduction digital tweaking
1957,but this neednot mean the death of art
1958,quite the opposite
1959,predictions that sound would destroy cinema and then that colour would fatally weaken its constitution eventually proved exaggerated
1960,all those innovations needed was artists who could use them properly
1961,and even now there are signs that the most highminded directors are intrigued by the ability of computers to blur the distinction between our visual and emotional perceptions to let them write with light
1962,in the lady and the duke the veteran director eric rohmer used cgi to set his historical drama against pastiches of period painting and printmaking rather than a conventional reconstruction
1963,instead of painting out anachronism he used the technology to paint in period
1964,others will come who will make even subtler use of the opportunity to align what they see in their heads with what we all eventually see on the screen
1965,we are in at the birth in fact of the most intensively manipulated cinema weve ever known and that manipulation will not always be bent solely on making teenagers moan awesome
1966,the battle is already lost but in the end there may be no losers
1967,it would be a pity if celebrations of the queens golden jubilee became confused with the debate about the future of the monarchy
1968,the one looks back in gratitude the other contemplates the serious issue of how the next head of state and those thereafter should be chosen
1969,in our private lives we try to avoid muddling up the two things
1970,we donot say thank you to somebody for a job well done over many years and at the very same ceremony so to speak when the presentations are made and the speeches given loudly discuss whether it couldnot all be done better in the future
1971,we leave that for another day
1972,let us cast our minds back years
1973,on february king george vi died in his sleep
1974,his valet discovered the body at 730am
1975,it was nearly noon in london before the news could be given to his eldest daughter elizabeth who was thousands of miles away in kenya
1976,she had taken the kings place on a commonwealth tour
1977,a courtier saw her as she was preparing to return to london
1978,she was sitting erect no tears colour up a little fully accepting what lay ahead
1979,the new queen was years old
1980,for the first years of her life that is until the abdication of her uncle king edward viii neither she nor her father had expected that they would in turn ascend to the throne
1981,it was the last thing that her father who loved a quiet family life and had a disabling stammer wanted to happen
1982,he was initially terrified
1983,but the queens father didnot turn away like his brother
1984,he did his duty
1985,the queen has followed this example
1986,this aspect of the queens upbringing and character needs to be taken into account if the many assessments that will be made of her during this golden jubilee year are to be fair
1987,in the hereditary system the task falls to you
1988,your only choice is whether to do it conscientiously or not
1989,even to do it to the best of your ability unremittingly for long years and more
1990,yes if that is how it turns out
1991,when her father was king elizabeth used to look through the windows of buckingham palace at the people and cars in the mall wondering what they were doing where they were going what they were thinking
1992,nobody else has had such a life with its isolation with its ceaseless pressure with its stern requirements
1993,when still only she made a famous public vow in a broadcast during a visit to south africa i declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong
1994,substitute commonwealth for imperial and it can be see that she has fully kept her promise
1995,now i say that for doing a difficult arduous job for half a century the queen deserves heartfelt thanks
1996,on this point it is irrelevant whether one is a monarchist or a republican
1997,indeed the monarchical system is the more unforgiving
1998,we watch and we criticise whomever the hereditary principle places willing or unwilling capable or incapable on the throne
1999,many years ago the queen told her riding master that had she not been who she was she would like to have been a lady living in the country with lots of horses and dogs
2000,how should the nations thanks be expressed
2001,many local authorities remain reluctant to organise or finance celebrations
2002,they are waiting i think to read the public mood
2003,this hasnot yet formed
2004,but it will become clear
2005,at the last jubilee years ago the result was that a large number of spontaneously organised street parties took place all over the country
2006,on the death of princess diana a completely different feeling quickly manifested itself
2007,it was griefstricken but also cross with the royal family for its cool response
2008,the golden jubilee mood will be i think warm grateful and respectful
2009,street parties may well seem inappropriate this time
2010,that doesnot matter
2011,for the plans already in place are quite sufficient for the occasion
2012,starting with cornwall on may the queen is making a series of visits to all parts of the united kingdom
2013,she finishes in lancashire on august
2014,in the middle of this period will be a concentrated four days of festivities
2015,on june and june respectively free classical and a pop concerts will be held in the gardens of buckingham palace on june jubilee churches services and bell ringing will take place across the country and the next day a procession with the gold state coach will go to st pauls cathedral for a thanksgiving service followed by lunch at the guildhall
2016,in the queen asked president de gaulle who had come on a state visit what he thought her role should be
2017,he perfectly understood in the station to which god has called you be who you are madam that is to say the person in whom your people perceive its own nationhood and by whose presence and dignity that national unity is upheld
2018,presence and dignity
2019,those she has provided
2020,even in these days of transchannel europhoria our european allies are still some way away from agreeing a joint foreign or social let alone education policy
2021,so it was quite a feat for the london ambassadors of four major european nations to coordinate a joint message to the government and people of britain regretting the sad state of language teaching in this country
2022,their complaint that british schools are so uninterested in languages that european schools find it hard to arrange school exchanges was nicely timed to catch the latest instalment of our continuing national debate about linguistic competence which is conducted under the working title why are we so awful at languages
2023,with all due deference to their excellencies and considerable trepidation i would venture another view about the british and their linguistic abilities and i do so from the rare but thankfully not yet unique position of being by training a british linguist
2024,contrary to common belief here and abroad a british linguist is not a contradiction in terms
2025,this country does produce a respectable crop of graduate linguists
2026,most leave university thoroughly competent in one more often two foreign languages
2027,their university course will have included a spell abroad perhaps as long as a year
2028,many of these graduates will also have studied two or three foreign languages at school one or more to alevel
2029,the armed forces and the diplomatic service train their own staff in socalled hard languages such as arabic or japanese as and when they need them
2030,these diverse routes to language acquisition may not be the most efficient use of resources but they yield results
2031,british linguists are among the best in the world
2032,when we put our minds to learning languages we learn them systematically and well
2033,i defy anyone to say that a native english speaker has a worse ear for languages than a native french german italian or spanish speaker
2034,where we are genuinely deficient is in making every pupil proficient in at least one foreign language
2035,and here motivation is a large part of the problem
2036,it is not only practical and necessary for most foreigners to be able to speak english it is also and at school this is crucial fashionable
2037,however routine and boring english lessons at schools in france and germany may be many pupils will go home and listen to cds or surf the internet in english
2038,london hardly needed the now abandoned cool britannia campaign to attract young europeans
2039,it is seen even in paris madrid and rome as the youth capital of europe
2040,that is not the only reason for the onesidedness of applications for school exchanges
2041,english is the first foreign language in most european schools
2042,even if all british children learning french took part in an exchange to a french school and vice versa there would still be the german italian spanish austrian dutch and belgian schools that would want an exchange with a british school
2043,there are simply not enough british schools or pupils to be exchanged
2044,many young britons are making quite a rational decision when they neglect their language classes a decision that has little to do with the quality of the tuition
2045,there are many things that they will need in later life but right now with all the other demands of the national curriculum language learning seems more of a luxury than a necessity
2046,the first task for schools must be to convince young britons that a foreign language is if not necessary then at least desirable
2047,starting a first foreign language much earlier seven is being suggested would at least convey that it is a basic rather than a supplement
2048,british reserve and adolescent shyness also make arguably the worst time to start learning a foreign language in a big class
2049,despite the howls from many of my fellow linguists i also tend to support the education secretary estelle morris in allowing 14yearolds to abandon their foreign language
2050,if they have no interest or are not making progress by then it is a waste of everyones time and money for them to continue
2051,the corollary though should be not just the earlier start to languagelearning but the provision of more opportunities in the form of subsidised nonschool courses later in life when need inclination and interest might all coincide
2052,to that end universities and colleges should be encouraged to open up their language training facilities to as wide a participation as possible
2053,the combination that i took at school classics german and russian is now even less available in schools than it was then despite the promise that big comprehensives would make aminority subjects more viable
2054,in the future it will probably still be the few those whose interest is tweaked by travel foreign friends or a sympathy for language who form the next generation of british linguists but lets give far more people a chance
2055,every year each student will spend at least on living costs such as rent travel and food
2056,on top of that will be tuition costs averaging around over the study period
2057,research shows that an average student will expect to owe around by the time they have completed their university studies
2058,she was the bestselling queen of the romantic aga saga
2059,he was the enfant terrible of the righton urban literati
2060,would the earth move when their paths crossed
2061,i quite like joanna trollope shes warm engaged and responsive and clearly has her heart in approximately the right place
2062,to me she is a quintessentially english phenomenon the lowermiddlebrow novelist who has just enough sophistication to be able to convince her readership that they may be getting an uppermiddlebrow product
2063,shes also quite vulnerable joanna and has had quite a monstering from the daily mail that paper bastion of agashire which is of course her proper province
2064,in an interview in another newspaper last week joanna seemingly admitted to leading a rather unseemly life nowadays cruising the london streets on the lookout for thirtysomething men to have uncommitted sex with
2065,she also posed for a photographer exhibiting her long slim legs clad in fishnet stockings
2066,predictably the envious wrath of middleaged middle england descended on her this scion of the sleeveless anorak and the liberty headscarf
2067,i was miserable and i then had stringers from the daily mail all over my patch in the country my mother
2068,everyone you can think of trying to get people to rubbish me
2069,and you do then feel like a cornered animal
2070,iam just so conscious a lot of the time that its horrible for my children having a wellknown mother its beastly having a parent in the public eye
2071,i observe to joanna that its really quite vulgar being famous and she concedes that it is
2072,she says that she continues to publicise her books quite as much as she does because shes always waiting to go out of fashion because with every book i think this will be it
2073,and i suppose ive had a sort of superstition about prolonging that moment but that after last week iam asking myself very seriously why
2074,she says that the remarks about sex she made were general rather than specific to her and were quite misrepresented
2075,anyway she said those things only after courteously answering a long string of sexual enquiries
2076,i believe her in all this
2077,joanna doesnot want to make a fuss although when i ask if shed like me to outline the dispute as i have above she says that would be excellent will
2078,joanna uses my first name quite a lot when we talk and i think this is partly sincere and partly political
2079,shes quite attractive and looks as many have observed young for her years
2080,however not absurdly dorian grayishly so shes no marie helvin
2081,i think the brouhaha that surrounds poor youthful joanna has as much to do with her rotten old borough of a constituency as it does with anything intrinsic to her
2082,sitting on the other side of a boring coffee table in the dull matutinal hinterland of the soho members club in which we meet for an hour on a rainy weekday she looks sleek in flared leather trousers a hiplength woollen jacket with a leather collar and silver jewellery boadicea shieldboss earrings thin multistranded bracelet
2083,she looks in fact like what she is a million selling lady novelist of a certain age
2084,the trouble is that on the evidence of her conversation that age is about rather than and quite a young at that
2085,theres this business of the wills to begin with when i tell her that both my parents are dead hers are alive her emotion swells and prolapses all over the table oh will i am so sorry
2086,although she then qualifies this by conceding that its my children and my parents that shes sorry for
2087,the daily mail feels that joanna has reinvented herself as a leggy sex siren in order to flog more books particularly as her latest girl from the south features 30yearold protagonists and is set in the distinctly racy environs of parsons green
2088,but joanna says if i was once seen as a provincial housewife in a laura ashley cardie under an apple tree with labradors which was also a misrepresentation the life iam living now does not lack its own integrity it is not a false faade
2089,theres a sort of abiding irritation about being assumed somehow not to be true to yourself
2090,well indeed and i donot think for a minute joanna has selfconsciously and manipulatively created a new public image to sell books
2091,no i think shes distinctly immature and despite years of media exposure she doesnot quite understand that press interviews are not the place to discuss your jejune selfimage problems
2092,joannas had quite a bad time
2093,her second marriage of years ended in divorce three years ago and she had quite a severe breakdown that left her virtually incommunicado for a further year
2094,now shes living in west london she wonot be more specific as she savours her newfound metropolitan anonymity attending cultural events galore dating and of course writing more stories
2095,i think joannas quite modest but not as modest as she would like to be
2096,to me she says of her books i think theyare good with distinct weaknesses and sometimes i think i have a flash of insight
2097,but theres a huge difference between being good and being great
2098,its very difficult to know isnot it looking at our contemporaries who will emerge as great
2099,yknow i think the odd john fowles will
2100,penelope fitzgerald i think will but iam under absolutely no illusion about where i fit in
2101,iam right for these times ive got a kind of acuteness about contemporary relationships thats right for now but its not going to be right for ever
2102,discounting the oddity of finding myself bracketed with her as a contemporary of j fowles b1926 and p fitzgerald b1916 which rather stretches the notion of contemporaneity beyond the bounds of my sense i find this umble dismissal of her craft by joanna as being mere acuity quite difficult to take as the only other writer she ascribes it to is the one she insists on calling the real trollope
2103,no joanna has that affectation of the successful of appearing to be dismissive of her own standing while clearly believing that the important voting is done by the feet of a thousand thousand readers
2104,i read every review and the bad ones if written by someone i admire i take really to heart i mean i think we can all profit from them
2105,but the people i have the greatest faith in are the readers
2106,they are amazing theyare the ones that have contributed to professional confidence
2107,well indeed and why shouldnot she feel that way
2108,joanna has quite a passion for the queer intimacy afforded her by her craft
2109,to me she says i met a woman in france last year who said to me youve been sitting in my kitchen for the last three years
2110,she admits quite shamelessly that she conducts numerous interviews as part of the research for her novels but when i put it to her that this suggests she doesnot have much faith in her imagination she vehemently asserts iam not looking for information iam looking for what i expect to be the case to be confirmed
2111,shes been quite nettled by reviewers whove said that her thirtysomethings in the latest book wouldnot use the archaisms she ascribes to them i wanted to hear it in their language the urgency of their feelings
2112,i think the truth is that her interviewees whom joanna obtains by word of mouth come from exactly her milieu and that explains why they all sound rather like characters in a joanna trollope novel
2113,this quite blinkered perception of the world is common to the novelist and the books
2114,joanna is the sort of woman who says iam just like every woman of my generation we can all speak adequate french we all went to ballet class and we can all ride
2115,the missing adjectives in her sentence being quite clearly uppermiddleclass english
2116,in a whole class we would call this attitude bigotry in a single woman of joannas age and breadth of experience one can only call it naivety
2117,her observations on the current generation of thirtysomethings as against her own generation at that age are inconsistent and nearcontradictory
2118,she says to me at one point theyare not politicised like my generation were at university
2119,theres no clearcut ambition for the world the way i remember it at university in the sixties
2120,yet a few minutes later she announces theres a freedom for radicalism now that there really wasnot when i was growing up
2121,i mean that was one of the things that charmed me about the age group in this book how free they are of so many of the assumptions and prejudices that we all grew up with in the sixties
2122,still i wouldnot wish tedious consistency on joanna any more than i want her dragged back to the shires kicking and screaming
2123,she concedes that her success and consequent wealth have divorced her somewhat from her readers but shes determined not to lose touch with the little daily lacerations of the spirit that she writes so acutely about
2124,i suspect the truth is that while joanna remains so in thrall to the way she and her work are received by the world there are plenty more little lacerations in store for her
2125,and thats quite a shame
2126,space shuttle columbia and a crew of seven blasted into orbit this morning on a mission to renovate the hubble space telescope
2127,after a oneday wait for warmer weather columbia went into clouds just before dawn as hubble was passing nearly overhead
2128,the launch was surrounded by extraordinarily tight security to guard against possible terrorist attack
2129,f15 fighter jets were on patrol and a nofly zone was in force within miles of the launch pad
2130,nasas oldest shuttle fresh from an overhaul had a perfect start to its 11day flight
2131,its been two years and seven months since columbia last flew said shuttle manager james halsell
2132,it got onto orbit without even as much as a minor fault message much less any type of major alarm
2133,columbia is loaded with million of scientific power and steering parts for hubble
2134,the astronauts will conduct five spacewalks next week to install all the equipment on the 12yearold telescope
2135,the parts include stronger solar wings more robust powercontrol unit more reliable steering mechanism refrigeration system to resuscitate a disabled infrared camera and advanced camera to increase hubbles capability for discovery by times
2136,nasa considers this the most complicated hubble servicing mission yet because of the heavy workload and a pair of unprecedented spacewalking jobs
2137,neither the powercontrol unit nor infrared camera repairs were meant to be tackled in orbit
2138,before the old powercontrol unit can be removed and the new one installed all of hubbles systems must be turned off for the first time ever in orbit
2139,scientist say there is a greater chance that the current power unit will eventually fail than there is that the telescope or even a major portion of it will not come back on following the repairs
2140,this is nasas fourth visit to hubble
2141,the first service call in corrected the telescopes blurred vision
2142,one more servicing mission is planned after this one in
2143,then if nasa has its way the telescope will be returned to earth in for museum display
2144,nobody expects the spanish inquisition
2145,was a wellknown and much remembered phrase from a sketch in the monty python series of the early 1970s
2146,but now at last the spanish can get their own back by chortling todos saber de uno soldado marino ingles
2147,whenever the odd royal marine crops up on one of their beaches by mistake
2148,the spanish policeman who reacted with charming aplomb at the invasion that never was will probably be kicking himself that he didnot come up with good morning commander bond weve been expecting you
2149,nevertheless the spanish emerge with great credit for not overreacting to the tread of foreign boots on their sand
2150,in elizabethan times a dead monkey washed up on a beach would spread alarm and anxiety about imminent invasion and protestant plots
2151,but now the spanish have the experience derived from decades of watching tattooed brits in replica football shirts trashing their coastal towns and this has probably reduced the spanish authorities to a weary acceptance of the extremes of our behaviour
2152,indeed they might well have believed that the incoming commandos were an advance party of hooligans doing a recce for a forthcoming champions league game
2153,rather than counterattack or run away somebody in the spanish chain of command must have realised pretty quickly that here was a golden chance to neutralise certain longrunning iberian stereotypes and set up some new anglosaxon ones instead
2154,forget the magnificence of sir francis drake raiding cadiz he is so over
2155,now your english publicschool officer class cannot even find gibraltar on a sunny day
2156,ha
2157,indeed it is the negotiations over the future of gibraltars sovereignty that will have been most affected to spanish advantage by this incident
2158,you can imagine the quiet smirks on the faces of spanish diplomats when they next meet their british counterparts
2159,the amusing thought may cross the spanish consciousness that they are no longer dealing with a democratically elected government that is a partner to spain in the european community but an outofcontrol junta ready to turn to military force at the slightest excuse
2160,didnot the british government run something rather sinister up the flagpole last week about licensing mercenaries to enact foreign policy
2161,could this have been the first dry run for these rogue elements giving a warning to spain about what might kick off if they do get their hands on gibraltar
2162,the timing is suspicious to say the least
2163,in all cold wars the enemy likes to test the nerves of its opponents
2164,some of you may remember all those soviet fishfactory ships that used to cruise the north sea eavesdropping on our radio transmissions and looking for weaknesses in the eastern seaboard defences
2165,so perhaps the spanish shouldnot feel so smug after all
2166,maybe it is all a combined save gibraltar factiondogs of war plot to destabilise seor aznars confidence in el tony blair
2167,such conspiracy theories will be laid aside in due course once we realise that the spanish invasion of britain has been completed in mostly harmonious circumstances
2168,there are the hundreds of bright and noble spanish nurses who are helping out our beleaguered national health service in and around blackpool
2169,we should not forget either how much employment the spanish magazine hola
2170,has brought to this country for the hard working photographers and frontline journalists of hello
2171,its english counterpart
2172,the spanish have also taken over a large share of our southwestern fishing fleet and nobody will need reminding that a certain enrique iglesias has topped the british pop charts for the past three weeks
2173,bravo
2174,our best scientists used to be confined to university research
2175,now britain is profiting from their genius
2176,some criticisms of britain come and go others seem impossible to shift
2177,for nearly a century this country has lived with a sorry fact we have a disproportionate number of the worlds most inventive scientific minds but are truly terrible at exploiting them
2178,but all that is becoming a thing of the past
2179,the market bubble of showed that science in all its forms has a huge capacity to excite
2180,small university originated companies such as osmetech which makes a hitech nose de novo pharmaceuticals which makes genebased medicine and the nano technology researcher oxonica are just three that have sprung up and become the target of massive investment
2181,a wave of enthusiasm is washing over the uks academic scientific community as the belief grows that its work may finally see the commercial light of day
2182,a lot of the problem has been structural
2183,the scientific brains have traditionally been locked away in academic institutions
2184,within britains top universities extraordinary advances in medical science engineering and computing have been made but found nowhere to go
2185,in recent years the issue has been particularly acute in biotechnology where the pace of progress in gene and protein discovery and its application to medicine has outstripped all expectations
2186,but now spurred partly by the stockmarket success of a few highprofile companies vice chancellors have realised it is time to extract real value from their laboratory treasures
2187,the market bubble may have burst but there are still plenty of venture capitalists ready to dish money out to good ideas and the academic world is playing its part
2188,the products of these collaborations are known as spinouts and they are fast becoming the pride and joy of the universities
2189,spinout companies both small and large are emerging from their alma maters at the rate of more than a month
2190,two factors are at work
2191,the first is that the government under fire for not making more of british research and fearing another 1960sstyle brain drain has set up funding for the commercialisation of research in universities
2192,the second is that the universities themselves have been even more energetic in setting up bodies to promote the spinouts
2193,each has gone about it in a different way but among the top research faculties the results have been similar
2194,as peter hiscocks director of the cambridge entrepreneurship centre cec says there has been an important change of culture and there is starting to be a real entrepreneurial spirit among academics
2195,a lot of it has been about giving scientists a confidence many of them did not have
2196,as the universities have embraced industry via the spinouts they have encountered many of the problems regularly faced by industry such as the ownership of intellectual property ip funding and equity distribution
2197,coping with these has become a crucial task for these newly formed enterprise bodies
2198,oxford university has produced some of the highestprofile spinouts in recent years achieving a particular string of successes in biotechnology
2199,listed companies such as powderject oxford glycosciences and oxford biomedica fall into this category but have been joined more lately by spinouts such as oxford ancestors which uses dna links to track genealogy and oxford biosignals which works in neuroscience
2200,oxfords success is largely due to its early adoption of spinouts
2201,in the university set up isis a subsidiary devoted to finding ways to commercialise its research
2202,as its director tom hockaday says though efforts have increased recently for years isis has been helping scientists to spin out companies
2203,most of our time is spent explaining to the university how industry works and to industry about how the university works
2204,oxford has traditionally maintained ownership of all the ip created by its research departments and taken stakes in the spinouts
2205,very recently it adopted a unique partnership with a company called ip2ipo a venture half owned by the investment bank beeson gregory
2206,in a deal struck last year oxford received 20m to build a new chemistry lab on the basis that ip2ipo would have the rights to per cent of the value of any ip generated in the chemistry department over the next years
2207,the structure has already produced two advanced materials spinouts inhibox and pharminox
2208,cambridge meanwhile has adopted a different approach
2209,situated at the heart of silicon fen amid hitech firms cambridge has long been a powerhouse of commercialised scientific research
2210,but much of it has arrived there without being closely tied to the university
2211,its emphasis is on education it does not want to be seen to be pushing academics but is dedicated to making it easier for them if they want to go commercial
2212,our mission is to build an entrepreneurial culture at cambridge university by teaching skills to the sort of people that will make ventures successful
2213,we have signed up thousands of students to our courses one of the most popular is the basics of building a business says cec director mr hiscocks
2214,for spinouts that take contracts out with the three yearold cec the university helps with finding investors and arranging mentoring by some of its older success stories and takes a per cent equity stake
2215,now working at the rate of two deals a week cambridge has produced spinouts over the past years
2216,two of the most famous are arm and autonomy which rapidly rose to the ranks of the ftse
2217,more recent spinouts include akubio a groundbreaking technology that allows accurate virus detection from dirty blood samples
2218,one innovations faculty that is close to breaking even belongs to londons imperial college
2219,its body imperial college innovations has produced spinouts since
2220,as its director brian graves explains the ip belongs to the college at first
2221,then once the spin out is complete it is assigned to the new entity and imperial takes a chunk of equity
2222,turbo genset the power generation company is among its most famous sons and ones to watch include powerlase and ceres in engineering and gene expression technologies in biotech
2223,a similar approach has been taken at southampton university
2224,its body the centre for enterprise and innovation cei has produced several highly commercial pieces of research and the flow of spinouts is rising fast
2225,its director tony raven says we try to be pragmatic
2226,if there is just one good idea we try to sell it to a company
2227,but if the idea looks as though it will lead to a string of other ideas that can be commercialised we encourage the creation of a spinout
2228,photonics is the prime example
2229,a very different but highly successful approach has come from umist in manchester
2230,unlike other universities umist has set up its own venture capitalstyle company to carry the scientific research through the whole process of incorporation
2231,its chief executive clive rowland is firm some universities use a general ward approach with a consultant coming in every so often
2232,we prefer an intensive care approach
2233,we are on top of the project all the time and we accordingly have very few casualties
2234,we donot like the sink or swim mentality
2235,significantly researchers at umist own their ip from the outset
2236,prime successes have been phototherapeutics a medical company and vics a pioneer of video imaging on mobile phones
2237,the spinout era is clearly upon us and many believe it could have enough impetus to blow away the traditional shortcomings of british industrys relationship with science
2238,as chris wright chief executive of ip2ipo says this is the perfect time to be in the business of scientific and hitech spinouts
2239,the government is ready industry is ready the academics are ready and the investors are ready
2240,with most big companies admitting that the days of their final salary pension scheme are numbered many employees will find themselves with a smaller retirement income than they may have anticipated
2241,ernst young and iceland both recently closed their final salary schemes not only to new members but to future contributions from existing members
2242,the schemes are thought too risky and expensive because of the poor performance of the stock market the rise in life expectancy and labours tax raid on pension funds since
2243,to ease the burden the government last week announced that it was relaxing the minimum funding requirement mfr which ensures that pension funds have enough cash to pay people on retirement
2244,but much of the damage has already been done
2245,in the past years says the tuc the number of people in final salary plans has fallen by
2246,million leaving just
2247,million in the schemes
2248,so what has happened to those who have lost their final salary benefits
2249,only are likely to have transferred to money purchase schemes leaving
2250,million fewer people with any form of occupational pension
2251,and with the recent acceleration in the closure of final salary schemes the real decline may be even higher
2252,over the last decade both employers and the state have been shifting responsibility for pensions provision on to individual employees many of whom have no idea how poor they will be when they retire or simply do not have the spare cash to make the savings needed to build up a sufficient pension pot of their own says john monks tuc general secretary
2253,final salary schemes guarantee that you will get a fixed proportion of your salary usually two thirds in retirement
2254,but when employers close them they are usually replaced with defined contribution or money purchase schemes which have no such guarantee
2255,the final pension is not determined by final salary but by a combination of the performance of the underlying investments and annuity rates at retirement
2256,they are much cheaper for employers as their contributions tend to be much lower while the employee takes on all the stock market risk
2257,if you find yourself in this position much will depend on the benefits built up in your final salary scheme so far which should be safe
2258,there are fears that those nearing retirement will be worst hit as they will have less time to do anything about the changes but if you have been a member of your final salary scheme for a long time the chances are that it will still make up a significant part of your pension
2259,those likely to feel the greatest impact are employees in their late thirties or early forties
2260,with final salary schemes the value of the employers contribution increases the older you get says adrian boulding pensions strategy director at legal general
2261,so at the age of your employer might pay per cent of salary increasing to per cent by the age of
2262,if you are turfed out of your final salary scheme into money purchase halfway through your career you will never get the highvalue contribution
2263,these people are really going to lose out and are most likely to need to top up their pensions
2264,everybodys situation is different and it is a good idea to get independent financial advice
2265,if you are on higher earnings with complex benefits arrangements you may be able to negotiate with your employer to fund this advice
2266,most employers will offer a money purchase scheme in place of the final salary pension
2267,if you have a choice do your sums carefully before accepting as it is likely to mean a huge loss for you
2268,if you are offered the option of staying with the final salary scheme or moving over to a money purchase scheme as many firms are giving their staff you should stay put advises donna bradshaw director of independent financial adviser fiona price partners
2269,the money purchase scheme may have very high employer contributions but even so you are better off with the final salary scheme
2270,if your only option is to join a money purchase scheme it is worth doing so as your employer will contribute
2271,work out how much this will be and how much it will cost to replace the benefits you would have received as part of your final salary scheme such as life cover
2272,compare this with how much you think you will need to live on in retirement
2273,you will have to make up the shortfall which may be possible through additional contributions to your employers money purchase scheme
2274,alternatively your company may have an additional voluntary contribution avc scheme that you can put money into
2275,or you could opt for a stakeholderstyle plan if you earn less than you can invest in a stakeholder alongside your money purchase scheme
2276,what is important is to shop around advises mr boulding and find out which is the most attractive vehicle in terms of the charges and range of investments
2277,the sangatte refugee camp has become the focus for the xenophobic tendency on this side of the channel
2278,but the existence of the camp does not give rise to the nightly game of trainhopping at rail yards near the french tunnel entrance
2279,as the chief executive of the refugee council said yesterday sangatte is a symptom not the cause of the pressure generated by people wanting to come to britain
2280,asylumseekers and economic migrants are desperate to get to these shores not because of the cornucopia of state benefits which are available they are not nor because we are unusually soft when it comes to enforcing immigration laws we are not but because we speak english and have a strong fullemployment economy
2281,the british should regard the modern siege of calais as a compliment and a potential benefit rather than a threat
2282,this country can gain a great deal as it has in the past from the determination hard work and enterprise of immigrants
2283,many of those refused refugee status should be invited to settle here and make a contribution to our economic and cultural life
2284,there are always likely to be however more people who want to come than will be granted permission and so borders will have to be policed
2285,as an island nation the practicalities are simpler than they are for other eu countries
2286,but the saga of sangatte has shown that in immigration matters no country is an island
2287,ideally a common immigration and asylum policy should be agreed at eu level
2288,that would make a reality of the idea of european citizenship
2289,sadly such an enforceable agreement is unlikely in the near future
2290,however if david blunkett develops his plans to allow limited immigration in addition to our duty of compassion towards those fleeing persecution it will make it easier to control the trainriders and lorry jumpers throughout the european transport network
2291,if economic migrants are offered the prospect of legal entry they will be marginally less likely to resort to desperate means of entry
2292,after englands overwhelming defeat of the admired ireland how long ago it now seems the london press sober broadsheets as much as xenophobic tabloids outdid even welsh supporters of the 1970s in lack of realism and sheer conceit which is saying something
2293,i did not undervalue the victory over an ireland side who as they showed against scotland on saturday can pile up points even though they may be losing the set pieces
2294,what i did do several times was warn against a french team in paris who had already beaten south africa and new zealand before christmas
2295,true several of the young backs who had participated in those wins every bit as significant as englands at twickenham were unavailable to the french coach bernard laporte
2296,but it was still clear he was moving towards the side he wanted despite the disappointing performances against italy and wales
2297,accordingly i find myself slightly in the position of the late politician william whitelaw speaking on the prom at brighton to a friend and myself
2298,edward heath had just told the tory conference that it would be wrong to gloat over the misfortunes of the labour government of the late 1970s
2299,i can tell you whitelaw said that iam gloating like hell
2300,it is one thing to be buoyed up with confidence quite another to believe you are the best in the world
2301,it is doubtful whether the england players really thought that
2302,but no one could have blamed them if they had
2303,they were certainly told it often enough over the past fortnight
2304,for this delusion the newspapers are primarily responsible
2305,they fell for the zurich financial services companys computer calculations with all the uncritical enthusiasm of a nineyearold presented with a playstation on his birthday
2306,a few months ago i was seated next to a suit from zurich at a luncheon
2307,he was a perfectly agreeable companion a scot as many of these insurance coves seem to be
2308,he said that few people seemed to know what zurich was or what it did
2309,hence the companys sponsorship of various activities and in particular its involvement in rugby union
2310,nothing wrong with this
2311,the company wants publicity and is prepared up to a point to pay for it
2312,but the claim that a computer calculation can determine which country is at any given moment top of the world is frankly preposterous
2313,there is certainly a way of arriving at such a conclusion
2314,this is not through the world cup which is partly dependent on the luck of the draw
2315,it is rather through a competition involving australia england france new zealand and south africa
2316,the countries would play one another home and away something that does not happen in the six nations championship though it should
2317,the competition could i estimate be completed before christmas if it started early enough in the autumn
2318,alternatively there is no reason whatsoever why it should not be held in the summer which in northern europe at any rate is an entirely suitable season for rugby
2319,the championship could be held at fouryearly intervals by setting the gap between world cups
2320,i do not i may say seriously suppose that such a competition will come about in the immediate future or perhaps ever
2321,but it would be preferable to the somewhat haphazard prechristmas matches and the even more capriciously arranged summer tours
2322,and it would dispose of pieces of nonsense like the zurich computer
2323,it is doubtful whether england would have won in paris whatever plan they had adopted or however quickwitted they might have been in varying it
2324,the surprising thing about the match was not so much that england did not adopt plan b if there was one
2325,it was more that according to several reports they failed to implement plan a
2326,certainly it was madness to think as they presumably did once on the pitch that they could beat this or indeed virtually any french side by running at them from inside their own
2327,martin johnson foolishly chose to kick to touch near the goalline when he should have taken the three penalty points on offer though to be fair jason robinsons try came from one such adventurous decision
2328,on other occasions robinson kyran bracken jonny wilkinson and will greenwood who otherwise had a fine match were all culpable in failing to boot the ball into touch when they had the opportunity
2329,at one point johnson urging this course looked round in despair
2330,i sympathised slightly
2331,the french crowd treated him as if he were the demon poisoner of alsace who along with the presidents african diamonds and the headless corpse in the bois de boulogne is one of the staple subjects of french newspaper stories
2332,much worse things than johnsons punch at vicarage road go on in french club rugby every single weekend of the season
2333,last year the number of teachers resigning from state schools doubled
2334,sarah cassidy looks at how ministers are trying to staunch the haemorrhage
2335,the teacher shortage crisis has not gone away according to official statistics posted on a government website this week
2336,teacher vacancies have almost doubled in a year leaving state schools short of more than teachers with nearly of these in secondary schools
2337,the new figures come in the same months as mike tomlinson the chief inspector of schools warned that teacher shortages have become a areal problem threatening to jeopardise standards in schools
2338,and a recent study conducted for the national union of teachers found that almost per cent of trainee teachers leave the profession within three years of entering the classroom
2339,the number of fulltime teachers resigning doubled from in to last year with each secondary school losing an average of teachers
2340,yet despite these gloomy predictions there are now more teachers in schools than months ago and more than in
2341,that is because many heads with healthy school balances have used the money to create extra jobs
2342,meanwhile entries to teacher training in england are at their highest level for seven years
2343,however there are still nowhere near enough secondary school recruits
2344,teacher recruitment experts warn that the situation could reach a new crisis point in september when a new larger cohort of 11yearolds threatens to swell secondary school rolls by around pupils
2345,more than extra teachers will be needed just to keep class sizes at their current levels say teacher recruitment experts
2346,the teacher shortage ameltdown predicted by teaching unions however has so far failed to materialise
2347,schools have not been forced to run fourday weeks but many are struggling with vacancies that are proving impossible to fill
2348,this is because head teachers are using every weapon at their disposal to ensure that children do not have to be sent home says david hart general secretary of the national association of head teachers
2349,heads are relying on supply staff getting existing staff to cover for vacancies rearranging the timetable or even teaching children in large groups
2350,essentially schools have only kept going by relying on the good will of the existing staff
2351,but this does not always mean that pupils are getting a good deal argues alan smithers director of liverpool universitys centre for education and employment
2352,staff may be expected to teach outside their subject or the continuity of childrens education could be put at risk by a succession of supply staff
2353,a growing number of supply teachers is being used to plug the gaps
2354,of the teachers in the country around are supply staff compared with just over in
2355,john howson managing director of education data surveys estimates that supply teachers are costing schools more than million with agencies taking about million of that total
2356,in secondary its quite clear that the governments training grants and golden hellos are having a significant difference in some subjects he says
2357,however there is still concern that even with the increased number of applications its still not going to be enough to hit the targets in some subjects such as maths
2358,hart warns that this trend is draining schools budgets arguing that the cost of supply staff has gone through the roof
2359,it can cost schools up to a day to hire a supply teacher he says
2360,one london school has spent on supply staff according to mr hart
2361,supply agencies have received a spate of bad publicity recently
2362,one agency timeplan found itself at the centre of a storm of criticism in the wake of the trial of amy gehring the canadian supply teacher cleared of indecently assaulting school boys but who admitted having behaved inappropriately
2363,the agency had failed to pass on a warning that miss gehring might pose a risk to children
2364,ofsted has also found problems with the quality of supply staff saying that they often missed out on specialist training and were not as good as permanent teachers
2365,tomlinsons annual report concluded they perform less well than any other category of teacher with less than half of their lessons being good or better compared with two thirds of the lessons of qualified and permanent members of staff
2366,in the most extreme cases the difficulty of recruiting sufficient teachers to teach every class in the school is a major issue
2367,inspectors found that in secondary schools one in vacancies was filled by supply teachers
2368,this was having a damaging effect on subjects including modern foreign languages science and religious education they concluded
2369,schools received their share of the blame for failing to give supply staff enough advice on lesson planning teaching methods and how to manage behaviour ofsted added
2370,the situation was worst in deprived areas
2371,the proportion of poor teaching was considerably higher among temporary or supply teachers said the inspectorate
2372,in schools serving disadvantaged communities one third of the lessons taught by these teachers was unsatisfactory or poor
2373,but the agencies themselves cite ofsteds other finding that teaching standards in general have never been higher and argue that supply staff should share the credit for this success
2374,david rose of select education an agency that finds supply staff days of work every week admits that temporary teachers can be slightly outside the loop for the latest training but argues that the agency spent on training its supply staff last year
2375,i think that schools appreciate what we do because they realise that without the agencies these jobs would be much harder to fill he says
2376,we put in a lot of work matching the right people to the right job
2377,we are not just there for emergency cover we also help head teachers find long term solutions to hardtofill vacancies
2378,up to per cent of our people are in longterm positions of a month or more
2379,its only really where there is a real shortage of teachers in certain subjects in secondary schools that theres a real problem
2380,estelle morris the education secretary promised to make tackling teacher shortages her top priority when she was promoted after last summers general election
2381,she insists that the governments recruitment and retention efforts are having an effect and plans to aremodel the profession to encourage schools to make more use of classroom assistants
2382,all the evidence is that what we are doing on recruitment is working and what iam sure about as part of retention is giving teachers more support
2383,the money is there but the culture and structure to buy in that support rather than always buy extra teachers isnot there ms morris said recently
2384,head teachers believe however that more needs to be done to make teaching more attractive
2385,the official figures tell only half the story they argue
2386,and the teacher shortage is far worse than even the latest statistics suggest they warn
2387,improvements to recruitment and retention of teachers can only be won by making the job much more attractive both to those already doing it and to potential recruits says john dunford general secretary of the secondary heads association
2388,no one is accusing the government of complacency
2389,according to david hart general secretary of the national association of head teachers ministers believe that the improved teacher recruitment figures will do the trick
2390,the challenge is to stop the haemorrhage of staff from the profession because of stress and excessive workload
2391,if the chancellor does not produce the money to deliver a decent workload reduction package then i believe the situation is really quite grim he says
2392,american computer giant ibm is so obsessed with miniaturisation that it is diverting huge resources into building microscopic computers
2393,the company which spends 6bn 42bn
2394,a year on research and development has decided that the future lies in machines that are practically invisible to the naked eye
2395,ibm will be spending a significant proportion of its research budget on the science of nanotechnology the process of making devices the size of a single molecule
2396,some analysts believe the project will run into billions of dollars
2397,ibms excitement over the potential of nanotechnology has been spurred to new heights by a report by the us national science foundation which forecasts that the global nanotech market will be worth trillion 700bn in the next years
2398,that growth will be achieved by making many existing technologies redundant
2399,this will be very disruptive stuff a spokesman said
2400,the company believes it will shortly be possible to string moleculesized processors together to form a tiny but enormously powerful computer and that it may eventually be possible to shrink the supercomputers that now fill rooms to the size of a wristwatch
2401,ibm is investigating many potential uses for the new technology including the design of selfrepairing materials and machines
2402,another use is producing sensors that can detect infinitesimal changes in atomic structure
2403,this is expected to lead to devices that can instantly detect biological or chemical weapons an idea that has caused great interest in the pentagon
2404,but ibms chief focus will be on the potential computing power of nanotechnology
2405,the group has created a prototype of a transistor that uses carbon rather than silicon
2406,the different material allows its inventors to produce a transistor times thinner than a human hair
2407,ibm researchers have even speculated that nanotechnology could replace silicon chips and hard disks because information will eventually be able to be stored at the atomic level
2408,ibms drive to embrace nanotechnology coincides with growing interest from global governments and investors
2409,a us government initiative has an annual budget of 604m and other countries are pushing ahead too
