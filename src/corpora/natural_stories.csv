0,if you were to journey to the north of england you would come to a valley that is surrounded by moors as high as mountains
1,it is in this valley where you would find the city of bradford where once a thousand spinning jennies that hummed and clattered spun wool into money for the longbearded mill owners
2,that all mill owners were generally busy as beavers and quite pleased with themselves for being so successful and well off was known to the residents of bradford and if you were to go into the city to visit the stately city hall you would see there the crest of the city of bradford which those same mill owners created to celebrate their achievements
3,it shows a sinister looking boars head sitting on top of a well which seems puzzling at first but the reason for this symbol is a matter of legend
4,there was once legend has it a fearsome boar which lived in a wood located just outside the manor of bradford
5,a source of great trouble to the local folk the boar was bringing terror to the peaceful flocks and ravaging the countryside around
6,even worse however the boar most liked to go to the well that was in the wood and drink its fresh water so that the people of bradford had second thoughts about visiting the well
7,that the people of bradford bore the brunt of the beasts ferocity was unfair in the eyes of the people of the region
8,eventually the issue reached the ears of the kindly lord of the manor who the people had often asked for help
9,the lord saw the severity of the problem the people faced and suggested a contest could solve the problem
10,he said that whoever could kill the boar and bring as proof its head to the manor house would be rewarded with land and fame
11,it was the people of bradford and the people who knew them who rejoiced at this proclamation but one question remained who would kill the boar by the handsome reward many felt tempted but the thought of the boar with its deadly tusks and face like thunder soon put an end to their ambitions
12,however there was one huntsman who was still wet behind the ears who decided the prize was worth a shot in spite of the boars reputation
13,the huntsman discovered the boar preferred to come out in the middle of the day
14,so he went to the wood by the well with his good bow to bide his time
15,around noontime the boar feared by the locals came out as slow as a snail from among the trees just as the huntsman had predicted
16,the huntsman leaped from his hiding place and through the heart with his fine arrows shot the boar
17,now the problem was no longer to kill the boar
18,it was to find a way to carry the boar back
19,the head was too heavy for the little huntsman to carry back to the manor house but the huntsman who was as quickwitted and cunning as ever asked himself what else can i do to prove i killed the boar the next instance he opened the boars mouth and cut out its tongue taking that as proof for the lord
20,he set out for the manor house as quickly as he could and he had only been gone a few minutes when a second huntsman not so bold as the first but a little more cunning came on the scene
21,seeing the slain carcass of the boar the huntsman rejoiced in his good fortune
22,the second huntsman knew a shortcut to the manor house was just around the nearby pond and being a bigger man than the first was able to pick up the boars head and carry it through the wood towards the prize that awaited him
23,the lord of the manor was seated in his hall when the second huntsman burst through the door and began to spin a line
24,the woes of bradford are ended he announced
25,with my own hand i have slain the boar and with that at the feet of his lord he dropped the boars enormous head
26,then you will be rewarded as i promised
27,but first let me examine the head of this monster said the lord of the manor
28,to not examine the head in advance had not been very clever on the part of the huntsman
29,right away the lord noticed the tongue of the boar was missing and exclaimed what is this a boar with no tongue he looked at the huntsman dubiously
30,how come this creature has no tongue he demanded
31,all eyes were on the huntsman
32,the huntsman questioned by the lord replied i cannot say my lord
33,he was suddenly realizing his tricky situation could end badly for him
34,through the door at this moment the first huntsman burst
35,the woes of bradford are ended he cried
36,i have slain the boar the people of bradford dreaded all eyes turned to the man who now stood in the doorway
37,the reward is already given said the lord of the manor
38,the man here has brought to me the boars head
39,then where is its tongue the first huntsman replied
40,and so saying he drew out the boars tongue he had put in his hunting pouch and related how he had ambushed the creature in the wood and cut out its tongue as proof of his victory
41,listening to the tale the lord of the manor tried to discern which huntsman was telling him the truth and what the two huntsmen were thinking as they waited for him to make a decision
42,almost instantly the lord saw that the second huntsman had fed him a pack of lies and it was the first huntsman who was the true savior of bradford
43,the lord believed the second huntsman had tried to steal the first huntsmans prize and so proclaimed the first huntsman the true victor
44,the lord wondered for a moment why he always encountered so much chicanery in his everyday interactions
45,the huntsman who had earned his prize fair and square received as his reward a piece of land just outside the town known thereafter as hunt yard
46,his fame was indeed assured but it was not nearly as lasting as that of the fearsome bradford boar
47,a clear and joyous day it was and out on the wide open sea thousands upon thousands of sparkling water drops excited by getting to play in the ocean danced all around
48,one of these was a merry little fellow named aqua who danced on the silver backs of the fishes as they plunged up and down in the waves and no matter how high he sprung he always came down again into his mothers lap
49,his mother you know was the ocean and very beautiful she looked that summer day in her dark blue dress and white ruffles
50,by and by the happy water drop tired of his play and looking up to the clear sky above him thought he would like to have a sail on one of the white marshmallowlike clouds instead of spending his whole life in the ocean
51,of the sky little aqua had always been afraid but he decided to finally face his demons and suggested a solution involving the sun carrying him up to the sky would be ideal
52,the sun understood aquas request came from his heart so he acquiesced and also took ever so many other drops so that aqua might not be lonesome on the way
53,it was only the sun that knew this however for all the other drops had been changed into fine mist or vapor and aqua could not see them
54,do you know what vapor is if you breathe into the air when it is cold enough you will see it coming out of your mouth thick and fast like steam
55,when the vapor is quite near the earth we call it fog
56,into vapor the water drops that danced in the ocean had been changed because in their own shape they were too heavy for the sunbeams that the sun let out to carry
57,higher and higher they sailed and though it was grand aqua and his friends were like fish out of water so they grew quite dizzy
58,they enjoyed looking down on the world below while the wind scattered them across the four corners of the earth but after a while it grew nearly time for the sun to go to bed
59,he became very red in the face and began to sink lower and lower until suddenly he went clear out of sight poor little aqua frightened by the impending cold and darkness wished he could sleep not in the sky but somewhere closer to earth
60,then aqua heard the wind blow and conjectured that maybe the wind could take him back down to the ocean
61,indeed the wind took pity on him and fanned him together with all of his brothers and sisters into a heavy gray cloud after which he blew them apart and told them to hurry down fast and furious to the earth so they could have a fighting chance of reaching the ocean
62,down they went rolling over each other until with a patter and clatter and spatter they touched the ground and all the people that the raindrops fell on cried its raining and took out their umbrellas
63,some of the drops that were the most fortunate including aqua fell on a mountainside and down the rocky cliff they ran
64,together they plunged into a mountain brook which came foaming and dashing along leaping over rocks and rushing down the hillside until in the valley below they heard the strangest clattering noise
65,the little water drops were then able to make out a flour mill that was standing on the bank
66,inside the mill the water drops saw two great stones which the big wheel kept whizzing round and round
67,the stones smoothed by the spinning were busy grinding the wheat into flour and the corn into golden meal
68,but what giant do you suppose it was who could turn and swing that tremendous wheel no giant at all
69,it was just our tiny little water drops who sprang on it by hundreds and thousands and whirled it over and over
70,it was lucky for the water drops that the brook where they were swimming next emptied into a beautiful pond where ducks and geese were living peacefully
71,aqua liked to play hideandseek in this pond and it was his brother water drop who he fooled by swimming to a big pool of water and pretending to hide there but then sneaking under a rock into an obscured little puddle
72,his brother had blatantly peaked and even followed aqua as he entered the big pool of water so when he searched there and could not find him he was extremely surprised and gave up
73,aqua liked this pond where he could play all day so he stayed a good while sailing up and down taking the ducks backs for ships and the frogs for horses but after a time he tired of the dull life and he and his brothers floated under a bridge for a long distance until they saw another brook tumbling down a hillside
74,come lets join hands cried aqua and because the water drops were all together overcoming the brook was childs play
75,it was by the help of aqua and his brothers that the bewitching river was able to float heavy ships though not so long ago it was only a little stream
76,as the river grew wider and he could almost see the ocean aqua realized his journey was almost over and he had come full circle
77,back in the ocean he felt right at home
78,for him this was the safest sweetest place in the whole wide world
79,during the warm summer evenings if you take a walk on the sea beach you will hear the gentle rippling swash of the waves and some say that it must be the gurgling voices of aqua and his brother water drops telling each other about their wonderful journey around the world
80,it was cold and nearly dark on the last evening of the old year and the snow was falling fast and furious
81,a little girl no one sheltered from the gelid air roamed through the streets with a bare head and naked feet looking as poor as a church mouse
82,its true she had on a pair of slippers her mother had once given her when she left home but they were as much use to her as a chocolate teapot
83,the slippers owned by her mother were so large that the emaciated little creature had lost them while running across the street to avoid two carriages that were rolling along at a terrible rate
84,one of the slippers she could not find and a boy seized upon the other saying that he could use it as a home for his little pet mouse
85,so with her naked feet which were quite red and blue with the cold the little girl went on wondering how she would get through this dreadful night
86,she approached an old hovel she had used as a shelter a few times before and found the entrance was locked
87,tough luck for the girl this day was even worse than the others
88,no good samaritan had given her even a penny
89,and she had no luck selling any matches that she carried in the old apron her grandmother had given her
90,poor little child she looked the picture of misery
91,on her long fair hair which hung in curls on her shoulders the snowflakes kept landing but she did not notice them as she shivered along
92,she was losing strength and beginning to doubt she could weather this storm
93,it was new years and the girl asked herself why as lights shone from every window and the savory smell of roast goose crept out on the streets she was outside all alone
94,exhausted she finally sat down in a corner behind the little bakery
95,she put a rag she had found over her legs to cover herself but she could not keep off the cold
96,the girl who the night air had completely enveloped dared not go home for she had sold no matches
97,her father had been mean and moody ever since his wife had gone to meet her maker
98,he would certainly beat her as he has done several times in the weeks past because she had not earned any money today
99,besides it was almost as cold at home as outside for they had only a patchy roof to cover them
100,the girls little hands were almost frozen solid so she decided that a burning match might be of some good
101,scratch sounded the match as she drew it out
102,how it sputtered as it burnt it gave a warm candlelike bright light that the girl hid from the world as she held her hand over it
103,why had no one wanted to buy even one match a wonderful light it was really
104,it seemed to the girl that she was sitting by a large iron stove with polished brass feet and a brass ornament
105,how the fire burned the girl was pleased and the fire actually seemed so warm that the child stretched out her feet as if to warm them when suddenly the flame of the match went out
106,it was a short stubby match that the little girl next rubbed on the wall
107,it burst into a flame and lo and behold the girl was transported from her dank city to a beautiful sunny forest
108,she heard the birds chirping and she was surrounded by wildflowers and birches as white as snow
109,a little squirrel hid some food in the ground and scurried off into the underbrush
110,the girl was curious so she dug some squirrel food up to see what it was but then she forgot to put it back
111,the squirrel came back and looked in its hiding place but the food was nowhere to be found
112,then the match went out and it wasnot the forest that remained before her eyes
113,it was only the thick damp cold wall
114,the girl looked despondently into the sky that was now fully darkened and suddenly she saw a star fall leaving behind it a bright streak of fire
115,someone is dying thought the little girl
116,it was her old grandmother the one who had loved her the most and the one who the girl used to visit every sunday who had told her that when a star falls a soul leaves this earth
117,it was her last match that the little girl now rubbed on the wall and the light again shone round her
118,her old grandmother in the brightness stood loving in her appearance
119,the girl understood her grandmother would soon disappear but she tried to play for time
120,grandmother cried the little one o take me with you i know you will go away when the match burns out the girl decided to light the whole bundle of matches in order to keep her grandmother there
121,the girl saw the matches glowed with a light that was brighter than the day and her grandmother had never appeared so large or so beautiful as she did in the light of the little matches
122,the grandmother then took the little girl in her arms and they both flew upwards in brightness and joy far above the earth where there was neither cold nor hunger and the little girl felt safe and peaceful
123,in the dawn of the morning there lay the poor little one not frowning but smiling and with a pale face leaning against the wall frozen and stone dead
124,she tried to warm herself said some
125,children who saw her were asking their parents why no one helped the girl who they knew looked dirt poor and helpless
126,passersby who saw her sitting motionless wished they could have helped the girl but their good intentions were a day late and a dollar short
127,other people suspected the girl had fallen asleep and frozen but no one imagined what beautiful things she had seen nor into what glory she had entered with her grandmother on new years day
128,once upon a time the birds took it into their heads that they would like a master and that one of their number must be chosen king
129,a meeting of all the birds was called and though they understood the birds who were from the most distant lands would be unable to come many birds came from faraway meadows and woods
130,the eagle who already thought himself the de facto king arrived fashionably late
131,it was a hawk who was most excited about the meeting because he was the dark horse for king
132,the small fry came too and the robin the bluebird the owl the lark and the sparrow who had only a chance in a million to be king were all present at the meeting
133,the cuckoo who was almost not invited because his call so annoyed the other birds came too
134,it was the very little bird who had no name at all however that would end up overturning the balance of power among the birds
135,that there would be great confusion and noise among the birds at the meeting was to be expected given the sheer numbers of birds that have gathered
136,there was piping hissing and clacking but finally it was decided that the bird that could fly the highest should be king
137,the little bird lay low near the eagle at first but the eagle did not notice the bird hopping onto his back right as the competition was about to commence
138,into the air in a great flock all the birds flew when the signal was given
139,the air was full of dust and it seemed as if a black cloud were floating over the field
140,you could hear the birds chirping and flapping from fields that were miles away
141,the little birds that soon grew tired fell back quickly to earth
142,the fact that the larger ones held out longer and flew higher and higher but the eagle flew highest of any surprised no one
143,could anyone stop the eagle that seemed to be flying straight into the sun the other birds gave out one by one and when the eagle saw this he thought what is the use of flying any higher this victory is in the bag and i am king then the birds below called with one accord come back come back it is you who must be our king because no one can fly as high as you
144,except me cried a shrill shrill voice and out of the blue the little bird without a name rose from the eagles back where he had lain hidden in the feathers
145,his guile was the ace up his sleeve and he laughed to himself at how easy it had been to outwit the other birds
146,higher and higher he mounted until he was lost to sight and then folding his wings together he sank to earth crying shrilly i am king i am king the eagle tricked by the little bird had not sensed the bird in his feathers and so had not at all expected the bird to come flying out like that
147,the birds back on earth were all up in arms
148,you and not the eagle our king the birds cried fuming with anger
149,you have done this by breaking every rule in the book so we will not have you who are simply tricky and cunning to reign over us
150,the bird without a name then decided to clear the air and said then let everyone start with a clean slate and perform a new challenging task
151,then we can decide who should be the real king
152,then the birds gathered together again and decided the case would be resolved by making a new condition which was that he should be king who could go the deepest into the earth
153,so the little bird who the other birds despised was now back to square one
154,confident he remained however that if he played his cards right he could be king
155,how the goose wallowed in the sand and the duck strove to dig a hole for the new task all the other birds tried to hide themselves in the ground too until they were practically blue in the face
156,the nameless little bird that was as bold as brass found a pitch dark mouses hole and creeping in cried i am king i am king but it was of no avail
157,you our king all the remaining birds who the littlest bird had outwitted cried again even more angrily than before
158,do you think we would reward your cunning in this way no no you shall stay in the earth till you die of hunger so they shut up the little bird in the mouses hole that the mouse gave up most unwillingly and bade the owl watch him carefully night and day
159,then all the birds went home to bed for they were very tired but the owl assigned by the birds to stand guard found his job was lonely and wearisome because he was just sitting alone staring at the mouses hole
160,i can close one eye and watch with the other he thought
161,so he closed one eye and stared steadfastly with the other but before he knew it he forgot to keep that one open and both eyes were fast asleep
162,then the little bird guarded by the owl peeped out and when he saw the owls two eyes tight shut he slipped from the hole and flew away
163,he wanted to shout i am king so that the owl could hear him as he flew but thought better of it
164,from this time on the owl fooled by the little bird has not dared to show himself by day for fear the birds should beat the living daylights out of him
165,he flies about only at nighttime hating and pursuing not the bird but the mouse for having made the hole into which the little bird crept
166,and the little bird also keeps out of sight for he fears that the other birds should punish him for his cunning
167,the rejection by the other birds was a bitter pill to swallow for the nameless bird the owl had let slip away
168,he hides in the hedges and when he thinks himself quite safe he sings out i am king i am king and the other birds in mockery call out yes yes the hedgeking the hedgeking at ten years old i could not figure out what it was that this elvis presley guy had that the rest of us boys did not have
169,he seemed to be no different from the rest of us
170,he was simply a man who had a head two arms and two legs
171,it must have been something pretty superlative that he had hidden away because he had every young girl at the orphanage wrapped around his little finger
172,at about nine oclock on saturday morning i figured a good solution was to ask eugene correthers who was one of the older and smarter boys what it was that made this elvis guy so special
173,he told me that it was not anything about elviss personality but his wavy hair and the way he moved his body
174,about a half an hour later the boys in the orphanage called down to the main dining room by the matron were told that they were all going to downtown jacksonville florida to get a new pair of buster brown shoes and a haircut
175,that is when i got this big idea which hit me like a ton of bricks
176,if the elvis haircut was the big secret then elviss haircut i was going to get
177,i was going to have my day in the sun and all the way to town that was all i talked about
178,the fact that i was getting an elvis haircut not just the simple fact that we were getting out of the orphanage made me particularly loquacious
179,i told everybody including the orphanage matron i normally feared that i was going to look just like elvis presley and that i would learn to move around just like he did and that i would be rich and famous one day just like him
180,the matron understood my idea was something that i was really excited about and said nothing
181,when i got my new buster brown shoes i was smiling from ear to ear
182,those shoes they shined really brightly and i liked looking at the bones in my feet which i had never seen before through a special xray machine they had in the shoe store that made the bones in your feet look green
183,i was now almost ready to go back to the orphanage and practice being like the man who all the girls loved since i had my new buster brown shoes
184,it was the new haircut though that i needed to complete my new look
185,we finally arrived at the unassuming unembellished barbershop where they cut our hair for free because we were orphans
186,even though we were supposed to slowly wait to be called i ran straight up to one of the barber chairs and climbed up onto the board the barber placed across the arms to make me sit up higher
187,i looked at the man and said with a beaming smile on my face i want an elvis haircut
188,can you make my hair like elviss i asked
189,the barber who was a genial young man grinned back at me and said that he would try his best
190,i was so happy when he started to cut my hair but just as he started to cut the matron who had been watching me and had a look as cold as ice motioned for him to come over to where she was standing
191,she whispered something into his ear that caused the barber to shake his head like he was telling her no
192,in response the matron walked over to a little man sitting in an office chair that squeaked as it rolled around the floor and spoke to him
193,it was the little man who then walked over and said something to the man who was cutting my hair
194,the next thing i knew the man who was cutting my hair told me that he was no longer allowed to give me an elvis cut
195,why not i cried desperately
196,the kindly barber stopped by the matron did not answer but from his expression i could tell that he wished he could cut it as i had asked
197,within a few minutes it wasnot an elvis haircut but a short buzz cut that the barber had given me
198,when he finished shaving off all my hair and made me smell real good with his powder the barber handed me a nickel and told me to go outside to the snack machine and buy myself a candy bar
199,i handed him the nickel back and told him that i was not hungry
200,iam so sorry baby he said as i climbed out of his barber chair
201,i am not a baby i said as i wiped the tears from my eyes
202,i then sat down on the floor and brushed away the hair that had accumulated on my shiny new buster brown shoes
203,my head was no longer in the clouds and i got up off the floor brushed off my short pants and walked sullenly towards the door
204,the matron was smiling at me sort of funny like
205,the barber upset by the matron said to her you are just a damn bitch lady
206,she yelled back at him at the top of her lungs before walking toward the office as fast as she could
207,to show his anger the man hit the wall with his hand and then walked outside where he stood against the brick wall smoking a cigarette
208,i understood right there my haircut was something that had been out of the power of the barber and then i slowly walked outside to join the man
209,he looked down smiled at me then he patted me on the top of my bald as a coot head
210,it was a fact of my life that i was not gonna have hair that was anything like elviss anytime soon
211,i then looked up at the barber with my wet red eyes and asked do you know if elvis presley has green bones this is a story of how mr
212,sticky got in abbys fish tank
213,hes very small abbys mom said as she peered at the tiny water snail
214,abby said that he would grow and then pulled her pajama bottoms up again before she got into bed for they were always falling down
215,usually abbys mom got up at the crack of dawn but it was abby who jumped out of bed first the next morning and switched on the light in her fish tank which contained three fish
216,at first she could see neither hide nor hair of the snail but then she spotted him
217,it had taken abby a while to find sticky because he was clinging to the glass near the bottom right next to the gravel
218,at school that day abby encouraged by her teacher wrote excitedly about the small and mysterious mr
219,sticky who you could mistake for a piece of gravel
220,he seemed an ideal pet for her some of the girls in her class teased because abby was also very small
221,that evening abby turned on the light and found mr
222,sticky clinging to the pond weed and bobbing about in the air bubbles
223,that looks fun abby exclaimed
224,she tried to imagine what it must be like to have to hang on to things all day and decided the answer was that it was probably very tiring
225,abby told her mom that she thought sticky had grown a bit the next day at breakfast
226,just as well if hes going to be gobbled up like that her mom responded who was busy preparing breakfast
227,abby whined that she didnot want him to get too big or he wouldnot be cute anymore
228,small things not big things are cute right she asked half to herself
229,the next day in art class abby needed two pieces of paper that were very expensive to draw an elephant but the teacher didnot mind abby using the expensive paper because she was pleased with the drawing and wanted it on the wall
230,the teacher who was always very encouraging remarked that the drawing abby had made was very creative and beamed at abby giving her the seal of approval
231,back at home mom convinced by abby to clean out the tank was cleaning with a special vacuum or hoover
232,wheres mr
233,sticky abby asked first thing when she came home from school
234,on the side mom replied
235,and then she added donot worry
236,i went extra slowly since its better to be safe than sorry
237,abby looked on all sides of the tank but there was no sign of the water snail that she had discovered a couple of days ago
238,she was very sad
239,her mom said to wait a few hours until the water clears to take another careful look
240,that evening abby went up to her bedroom to check the tank again
241,the water had settled and looked clear but abby could not see mr
242,sticky
243,abby kneeled down to have another look in the tank that her mom had cleared so thoroughly but mr
244,sticky was still nowhere to be found
245,abby was a bundle of nerves as she descended the stairs
246,in the study surrounded by books and papers her mom was working and she looked impatient when she saw abby in the doorway and even more worried when she heard the bad news
247,hell turn up mom said and that was that
248,then to add fuel to the flames she raised her tone of voice and said dismissively for the time being go to bed abby
249,ive got masses of work to catch up on
250,abby had a quick temper and she was angry as hell
251,youve hoovered him up havenot you she said accusingly
252,abbys mom denied abbys version of the story was true and said that she was careful but because mr
253,sticky was so small he was hard to see
254,whats wrong with being small nothing at all but it makes things hard to find
255,or notice abby said suddenly feeling like the small overlooked mr
256,sticky herself and storming from the room
257,the door to the bedroom opened a few minutes later and moms face appeared
258,she was there to try to make up for having been insensitive earlier
259,she had put her work on the back burner and occupied herself with sticky
260,abby who was breathing fire all on account of the little snail tried to ignore her but it was hard when mom walked over to the bed and sat next to her
261,mom who abby still strained to remain upset with had gone out to find her glasses in order to search for sticky more effectively
262,this is my new and extra powerful pair i have for important occasions like snail hunting she said
263,she smiled at abby trying to butter her up but abby didnot smile back
264,abby believed her moms idea would not succeed but then she had an idea of her own
265,ive got a magnifying glass abby suddenly remembered and rushed off to find it
266,on the floor beside each other they sat shuffling around the tank looking all over the place and peering into the corners among the big pebbles and the pond weed
267,abby tried to imagine if she were sticky a little water snail where would she hide out at one point she thought she saw him but it wasnot the water snail
268,it was a large speck of dust that was deceptively bobbing around in the water like a live animal
269,they were ready to call it quits when suddenly mom cried ah ha tucked in a curve of the archway perfectly hidden against a pitch dark stone sat mr
270,sticky safe and sound
271,you i can always count on abby said to her mom with relief
272,then she noticed another water snail was right next to sticky and asked where this new addition to the family could have come from
273,iam beginning to suspect the pond weed is guilty donot you think replied mom
274,they both laughed and climbed into abbys bed together and though it was cozy it was a bit of a squeeze
275,budge up mom said giving abby a push with her bottom
276,i canot because iam already on the edge
277,good heavens youve grown then
278,when did that happen you couldve put an elephant in here last time we did this
279,before i know it youll be all grown up
280,on her moms chest abby then put her head and smiled
281,the text message said that lucy josephs was a failure
282,it said she was ugly had no style and the world hated her
283,at least that was what it said to lucy
284,it said that and a whole lot more that she was struggling to understand
285,the actual text of the note said that lucy better not show up at the party tonight because it was going to be bad enough already lucy who had started receiving these messages a few weeks ago tapped the mobile screen to make the message disappear from view
286,she only wished it was as easy to tap her heart and erase the trace the message had left there
287,was that another one of those messages her mom asked who was driving the car
288,lucy confirmed her mothers suspicion was founded as she answered dejectedly iam sorry to say it was
289,havenot you reported it yet asked jill lucys older sister who was sitting in the passenger seat
290,yes lucy replied lying through her teeth
291,that lucy should not let the messages get to her and that the sender was only jealous were lucys moms arguments in an effort to comfort her daughter
292,lucys mom suddenly felt guilty for she had been the one to buy the phone for lucy just a couple of months ago
293,she then admitted her regret about the phone was still bugging her out loud as she sighed i never should have given you that phone lucy
294,no its fine
295,i love it said lucy knowing that affording the phone had been no small thing for her mother
296,it had been nothing but trouble though
297,lucy did not know who it was that was sending her the messages and she did not know how they had got her number but whoever it was he or she had slowly taken over lucys life
298,she was getting several texts a day now all of which were abusive and hurtful
299,lucy wondered what the person who was messaging her might be thinking or trying to achieve with all of their hateful messages
300,as the car pulled up outside the school which looked like a large shadow in the darkness of a november evening lucy felt a shiver run down her spine
301,hastened by jill who did not want to be late to her own concert lucy hesitantly stepped out of the car and walked toward the school
302,it was jill who in her final year of high school had become involved in helping organize this years school talent show and she took her position very seriously
303,lucy hurried behind jill pulling on the worn oversized coat that had originally belonged to jill in order to keep her dry as the raindrops fell all around them
304,as the sisters entered the hall where the show was to take place jill filled with excitement while lucy regretted that she had promised her mother she would participate in the show
305,to waste your talent would be a real shame for you have such a beautiful voice her mother had argued two months back when the concert was first announced
306,lucy had been considering it for she did love to sing
307,that very night the first text message had come through
308,how does it feel to be tall and lanky like a giraffe it had asked taking lucy by surprise
309,one of the popular girls lucy had always known she wasnot but before the messages began lucy had always been quite proud of being a little different
310,but text by text lucys selfconfidence had deflated and in the end it had taken some doing to get her to agree to perform in the show
311,now however lucy had no choice but to make her way towards the stage where jill was beckoning encouragingly to her
312,she was the first performer
313,lucy announced by her sister to the audience was all nerves as she walked out onto the middle of the stage where there was nothing but a microphone and her
314,she heard the audience applaud and could feel a sense of anticipation emanate from the other side of the heavy curtain
315,as the curtains began to part she cast a worried look at jill in the wings who assured her with a positive thumbs up
316,lucy thought to herself that she could not go through with this and that she unlike her older sister was not confident enough to put herself before the judging audience
317,the crowd looked up at her and lucy was ready to run when the first notes of the music sounded out and a sudden calm settled over her
318,she closed her eyes and shut everything out including the audience the nerves that threatened to take over the text messages and the way they made her feel
319,it was just her and the music and it was a love story that had been going on her whole life
320,she began to sing and all the pain and confusion that the messages had been causing inside her just flowed out
321,the words were not important for it was the feeling behind them that she latched onto
322,lucy was in the heart of the song with the rest of the world slipping away
323,when the song finished and the last note died away she opened her eyes
324,to see the whole audience on their feet and the hall filled with cheers and applause was not what lucy had expected
325,lucy allowed herself to enjoy the sense of achievement and belonging that she had not felt in a very long time
326,then she saw her mother who was cheering the loudest of all in the crowd and jill who was beaming at her with pride from the wings
327,she knew she owed them big time for reminding her what she was capable of and who she really was
328,the next time her phone bleeped she would tap the message straight into oblivion where it belonged
329,the roswell ufo incident was the alleged recovery of extraterrestrial debris including alien corpses from an object that crashed near roswell new mexico on or about july eighth nineteen fortyseven
330,since the late nineteen seventies the incident has been the subject of intense controversy and the subject of conspiracy theories as to the true nature of the object that crashed
331,the united states military maintains the debris recovered was from an experimental highaltitude surveillance balloon that belonged to a classified program named mogul
332,however many ufo proponents maintain that in fact a crashed alien craft and bodies were recovered and that the military then engaged in a coverup
333,the incident has turned into a widely known pop culture phenomenon making the name roswell synonymous with ufos
334,it ranks as one of the most publicized and controversial alleged ufo incidents
335,on july ninth nineteen fortyseven a press release that roswell army air field issued stated that personnel from the fields bomb group had recovered a crashed flying disc from a ranch near roswell sparking intense media interest
336,later the same day the commanding general of the eighth air force stated that in fact a weather balloon had been recovered by the roswell army air field personnel rather than a flying saucer
337,a subsequent press conference was called featuring debris from the crashed object that confirmed the weather balloon description
338,the case was quickly forgotten and almost completely ignored even by ufo researchers for more than thirty years
339,then in nineteen seventyeight nuclear physicist and author stanton friedman interviewed jesse marcel the only person known to have accompanied the roswell debris from where it was recovered to fort worth
340,over the next few years the accounts he and others gave elevated roswell from a forgotten incident to perhaps the most famous ufo case of all time
341,by the early nineteen nineties ufo researchers had interviewed several hundred people who had or who claimed to have had a connection with the events at roswell in nineteen fortyseven
342,additionally hundreds of documents were obtained by freedom of information act requests as were some that insiders apparently leaked
343,their conclusions were that at least one alien craft had crashed in the roswell vicinity that aliens some possibly still alive were recovered and that a massive coverup of any knowledge of the incident was put in place
344,numerous books articles television specials and even a madefortv movie brought the nineteen fortyseven incident fame and notoriety so that by the mid nineteen nineties strong majorities in polls such as a nineteen ninetyseven cnn time poll believed that aliens had visited earth and specifically that aliens had landed at roswell and the government was covering up the fact
345,during the nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties a new narrative emerged which was at strong odds with what was reported in nineteen fortyseven
346,this narrative evolved over the years from the time the first book on roswell was published in nineteen eighty as many new witnesses and accounts emerged drawn out in part by the publicity on the incident
347,of the hundreds of witnesses that the various researchers interviewed a seemingly impressive figure a comparable few were true witnesses who claimed to have actually seen debris or aliens
348,most of these socalled witnesses were repeating the claims of others and their testimony would be inadmissible hearsay in an american court
349,as for the several accounts from those who claimed to have seen aliens critics identified a variety of problems with them
350,these problems ranged from the reliability of secondhand accounts to serious credibility problems with witnesses making demonstrably false or internallyinconsistent claims to dubious deathbed confessions or accounts from elderly or easily confused witnesses
351,a basic problem with all the witness accounts according to the critics is that they all came a minimum of thirtyone years after the events in question and in many cases were recounted more than forty years after the fact
352,not only are memories this old of dubious reliability they were also subject to contamination from other accounts the witnesses may have been exposed to
353,though there had always been skeptics who had many objections to the plausibility of these accounts it was not until the mid nineteen nineties that a strong counterargument to the presence of aliens was widely publicized
354,the general accounting office launched an inquiry and directed the office of the secretary of the air force to conduct an internal investigation
355,the result was summarized in two reports
356,the first released in nineteen ninetyfive concluded that the reported recovered material in nineteen fortyseven was likely debris from a secret government program called project mogul which involved high altitude balloons meant to detect sound waves generated by soviet atomic bomb tests and ballistic missiles
357,the second report released two years later in nineteen ninetyseven concluded that reports of recovered alien bodies were likely a combination of innocently transformed memories of military accidents involving injured or killed personnel innocently transformed memories of the recovery of anthropomorphic dummies in military programs us conducted in the nineteen fifties and hoaxes that various witnesses and ufo proponents perpetrated
358,the psychological effects of time compression and confusion about when events occurred explained the discrepancy with the years in question
359,in january nineteen ninetyseven karl pflock one of the more prominent proufo researchers said based on my research and that of others iam as certain as its possible to be without absolute proof that no flying saucer or saucers crashed in the general vicinity of roswell or on the plains of san agustin in nineteen fortyseven
360,he then added the debris found was the remains of something very earthly all but certainly something from the top secret project mogul
361,although most now agree with this conclusion each year during july fourth weekend the city of roswell hosts the roswell ufo festival celebrating all things ufo featuring prominent ufologists and discussions
362,tulip mania was a period in the dutch golden age during which contract prices for bulbs of the recently introduced tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then suddenly collapsed
363,at the peak of tulip mania in february sixteen thirtyseven tulip contracts sold for more than ten times the annual income of a skilled craftsman
364,it is generally considered the first recorded economic bubble
365,the tulip introduced to europe in the mid sixteenth century from the ottoman empire became very popular in the united provinces which we now know as the netherlands
366,tulip cultivation in the united provinces is generally thought to have started in earnest around fifteen ninetythree after the flemish botanist charles de lecluse had taken up a post at the university of leiden and established a botanical garden which is famous as one of the oldest in the world
367,there he planted his collection of tulip bulbs that the emperors ambassador sent to him from turkey which were able to tolerate the harsher conditions of the northern climate
368,it was shortly thereafter that the tulips began to grow in popularity
369,the flower rapidly became a coveted luxury item and a status symbol and a profusion of varieties followed
370,they were classified in groups onecolored tulips of red yellow or white were known as couleren but it was the multicolored rosen red or pink on white background violetten purple or lilac on white background and to a lesser extent the bizarden red brown or purple on yellow background that were the most popular
371,these spectacular and highly soughtafter tulip bulbs would grow flowers with vivid colors lines and flames on the petals as a result it is now understood of being infected with tulipspecific virus known as the tulip breaking virus
372,the dutch golden age growers named their new varieties with exalted titles
373,many early forms were prefixed with admiral often combined with the growers names
374,general was another prefix that found its way into the names of around thirty varieties
375,later came varieties with even more superb names such as even admiral of admirals and general of generals
376,most of these varieties have now died out though similar broken tulips continue in the trade
377,tulips grow from bulbs and can be propagated through both seeds and buds
378,seeds from a tulip will form a flowering bulb after seventwelve years
379,when a bulb grows into the flower the original bulb will disappear but a clone bulb forms in its place as do several buds
380,properly cultivated these buds will become bulbs of their own
381,the tulip breaking virus which many botanists have studied spreads only through buds not seeds and so cultivating the most appealing varieties takes years
382,propagation is greatly slowed down by the virus
383,tulips bloom in april and may for about a week and the secondary buds appear shortly thereafter
384,bulbs can be uprooted and moved about from june to september and thus actual purchases occurred during these months
385,as the flowers grew in popularity professional growers paid higher and higher prices for bulbs with the virus
386,by sixteen thirtyfour in part as a result of demand from the french speculators began to enter the market
387,in sixteen thirtysix the dutch created a type of formal futures markets which merchants used to sell and buy contracts to buy bulbs at the end of the season
388,traders met at taverns and buyers were required to pay a fee per trade
389,people were purchasing bulbs at higher and higher prices intending to resell them for a profit
390,however such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs
391,in february sixteen thirtyseven tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs
392,as this realization set in the demand for tulips collapsed and prices plummeted
393,the speculative bubble burst
394,some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those on the open market while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth a fraction of the price they had paid
395,the event was popularized in eighteen fortyone by the book extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds that a british journalist charles mackay wrote
396,that crowds of people often behave irrationally was the main thesis of the book and tulip mania was one of the primary examples
397,according to mackay at one point twelve acres of land were offered for a semper augustus bulb
398,he claims that many such investors ruined by the fall in prices were desperate and dutch commerce suffered a severe shock
399,in mackays account the panicked tulip speculators sought help from the government of the netherlands which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a ten percent fee
400,attempts that were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties were unsuccessful
401,the mania finally ended mackay says with individuals stuck with the bulbs they held at the end of the crash
402,no court would enforce payment of a contract since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling and thus not enforceable by law
403,although mackays book is a classic that many publishing houses continue reprinting today his account is contested
404,many modern scholars believe the mania was not as extraordinary as mackay described with some arguing that the price changes may not have constituted a bubble
405,research on the tulip mania is difficult because of the limited data from the sixteen thirties
406,however some modern economists have proposed rational explanations rather than a speculative mania for the rise and fall in prices
407,for example other flowers such as the hyacinth also had high prices on the flowers introduction which then fell dramatically
408,the high prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost thus lowering the risk to buyers
409,despite these disagreements about whether the phenomenon technically constituted an economic bubble the term tulip mania is still often used metaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble when asset prices deviate from intrinsic values
410,tourettes syndrome a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive involuntary movements was named for dr
411,georges gilles de la tourette the pioneering french neurologist who first described the condition in an eightysixyearold french noblewoman
412,it is almost always in childhood that the early symptoms of tourettes are first noticed with the average onset between the ages of seven and ten years
413,it is estimated that two hundred thousand americans have the most severe form of tourettes and as many as one in a hundred people exhibit milder and less complex symptoms that include chronic motor and vocal tics or transient tics of childhood
414,for the majority of people diagnosed with the disorder tourettes is not a chronic condition with symptoms lasting a lifetime
415,rather it is a condition whose severity peaks in the early teens with improvement occurring in the late teens and continuing into adulthood
416,however approximately ten percent of those affected have a progressive or disabling course that lasts into adulthood
417,it is not uncommon for symptoms to be present for an extended period of time before a formal diagnosis of tourettes is obtained
418,the reasons for this are many and may include the fact that for families and physicians unfamiliar with tourettes mild and even moderate tic symptoms may be considered inconsequential part of a developmental phase or the result of another condition
419,for example parents may think that eye blinking is related to vision problems or that sniffing is related to seasonal allergies
420,there are many patients who are selfdiagnosed after they their parents other relatives or friends read or hear about tourettes from others
421,tics are classified as either simple or complex
422,simple motor tics are sudden brief repetitive movements that involve a limited number of muscle groups
423,some of the more common simple tics include eye blinking facial grimacing shoulder shrugging and head or shoulder jerking
424,simple vocalizations which motor tics typically precede might include repetitive throatclearing sniffing or grunting sounds
425,complex tics are distinct coordinated patterns of movement that involve several muscle groups
426,complex motor tics might include facial grimacing combined with a head twist and a shoulder shrug
427,other complex motor tics may actually appear purposeful including sniffing or touching objects hopping jumping bending or twisting
428,complex vocal tics include words or phrases
429,perhaps the most dramatic and disabling tics include motor movements that result in selfharm such as punching oneself in the face or vocal tics including coprolalia which involves uttering swear words or echolalia which involves repeating the words or phrases of others
430,tics are often worse with excitement or anxiety and better during calm focused activities
431,certain physical experiences can trigger or worsen tics
432,for example tight collars may trigger neck tics or hearing another person sniff or throatclear may trigger the production of similar sounds
433,tics come and go over time varying in type frequency location and severity
434,the first symptoms tourettes patients experience usually occur in the head and neck area though they may progress to include muscles of the trunk and extremities
435,the symptoms of tourettes are involuntary but there are some people who can sometimes suppress camouflage or otherwise manage their tics in an effort to minimize their impact on functioning
436,however people affected by tourettes often report a substantial buildup in tension when suppressing their tics to the point where they often feel that the tic must be expressed
437,tics in response to an environmental trigger can appear to be voluntary or purposeful but are not
438,many people with tourettes experience additional neurobehavioral problems that include inattention hyperactivity and impulsivity
439,people with tourettes have also reported problems with depression or anxiety disorders as well as other difficulties tourettes syndrome may or may not directly cause
440,tourettes is a diagnosis doctors make after verifying that the patient has had both motor and vocal tics for at least one year
441,the existence of other neurological or psychiatric conditions can also help doctors establish the diagnosis of tourettes is the correct one
442,knowledgeable clinicians consulted by patients do not often misdiagnose common tics
443,however atypical symptoms or atypical presentation such as onset of symptoms in adulthood may require specialty expertise for diagnosis
444,there are no blood or laboratory tests needed for diagnosis
445,however neuroimaging studies which include magnetic resonance imaging computerized tomography and electroencephalograms as well as certain lab tests may be used to rule out other conditions that tourettes might be confused with
446,in terms of the role of genes in the disorder evidence from twin and family studies suggests that tourettes is an inherited disorder
447,although early family studies suggested an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance characterized the condition more recent studies discovered the pattern of inheritance was much more complex
448,although there may be a few genes that have substantial effects its also possible that many genes with smaller effects and environmental factors may play a role in the development of tourettes
449,genetic studies also suggest that some forms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder are genetically related to tourettes but there is less evidence for a genetic relationship between tourettes and other neurobehavioral problems that tourettes commonly cooccurs with
450,an important role in tourettes gene expression is played by the sex of the person
451,in particular males affected by the gene are more likely to have tics and females who have a genetic predisposition are more likely to have obsessivecompulsive symptoms
452,much current research is aimed at better understanding the genetic basis and symptomology of tourettes as well as its relationship to related disorders
453,the hope is that this research leads to better diagnostic tools and better treatments for tourettes
