0,the renaissance in childrens literature is turning out to be one of the most striking cultural characteristics of our times
1,whether we are reassessing the achievements of the past as with the film of the lord of the rings or falling in love with current heroes like harry potter there has never been another time when childrens literature could command such attention
2,about six months ago i wrote on these pages that philip pullman's novel the amber spyglass would be a worthy winner of the booker prize
3,in the event it didnt make the shortlist but it lived to fight another day
4,on tuesday night pullman walked away with the whitbread prize
5,that prize thrives on the neat concept of first dividing books up into categories - novel of the year childrens book of the year and so on - and then breaking down the categories for its overall prize
6,that meant that these judges could give the award to philip pullman without being accused of dumbing down to the level of a childrens book
7,peculiarly this still seems to be a very real fear
8,although we are currently seeing such an unexpected outpouring of energy in literature for children many commentators are still afraid to admit that these books can stand alongside other literature
9,novelists such as philip hensher and howard jacobson have mocked the adults who eagerly turn the pages of the harry potter books or even worse queue up to see the film without the excuse of a seven-year-old child by their side
10,and when peter jacksons film of the lord of the rings was released sceptical critics such as mark lawson thomas sutcliffe and david sexton poured scorn on people who took their childish delights into adulthood
11,they seem to believe that people who sink into tales that shrug off the adult world are absurd or even a bit dangerous
12,in one critics words we are proof of the infantilisation of adult culture
13,but these critics who are proud to be too sophisticated to enjoy a book where a bear talks or a dragon flies might be missing out
14,they needn't be afraid that they will lose their critical edge if they let down their guard against childish things for an instant
15,do we still have to spell it out
16,it really is possible to like rowling and roth to enjoy pullman as well as proust
17,what is endearing about the new breed of childrens writers is that they are firing a new bolt of energy into literature
18,nave
19,yes they may be nave
20,but what they dont suffer from is the deadening claustrophobia of so much acclaimed literature for grown-ups
21,readers who fell on hyped novels such as jonathan franzen's the corrections or margaret atwood's the blind assassin only to find them imaginatively underpowered will know what i mean when i say that even the biggest novels today can seem much smaller than life
22,still perhaps those novels honestly reflect the problematic aspects of our current condition whereas the childrens writers have the liberty of escapism
23,that may be true
24,but sometimes it is worth going on these journeys - not just to escape but also to return
25,im sure im not alone in saying that after stepping into rowlings world or into pullman's world both of which thrive on the staggeringly precise and sensual detailing of their fantasy universes i found that the everyday world had juddered a little
26,without doubt they do lack other qualities that you look for in literature that isnt meant for children
27,but still rowling and pullman can achieve that precious effect on the reader of tearing away the veils of familiarity and reawakening one to the oddness and beauty of ordinary life
28,and lets not sidestep what is perhaps the most obvious point of these books appeal
29,as with j k rowling pullman fulfils an often unassuaged longing in this secular age - he describes a great battle between good and evil a battle where everything is at stake where you have to take sides
30,for some people this is just too simple to be enjoyable
31,they recognise that morality is always about shades of grey and they dont like being seduced into these grand images of deep black and dazzling white
32,but i find this engagement with ethical themes intriguing
33,and pullman's moral vision is the most refreshing ive seen in a childrens book for a long time because unlike so many others he does moral fervour without falling into a sub- christian message
34,on the contrary his work contains the most impassioned cry to accept the death of god since nietzsche
35,no wonder christians have shied away from his books
36,the amazon website where readers can post opinions contains hundreds of reviews from the united states many of them from parents who call his vision satanic and dark and terrifying and warn other families off them
37,the same can be heard here
38,claudia fitzherbert wrote in a newspaper yesterday christian parents beware his books can damage your childs faith
39,indeed they can
40,many writers who have tried to preach their atheism in their literature like writers who have tried to preach their religion have ended up weakening their vision
41,but here the loss of faith is made vivid and energetic
42,the thrust of the trilogy that is completed by the amber spyglass is to re-run the fall but this time sexuality and knowledge are good and authority is bad
43,the priests and the church are the embodiment of evil
44,the aim of the child protagonists is hardly unambitious - it is to destroy the dream of the kingdom of heaven and instead to put ones faith in building the republic of heaven in ones own lifetime
45,isnt this is a great vision for the world after 11 september
46,here we have a book that asks us to believe that we can build a new highly moral world without the precepts of religion
47,sure pullman ends up having his cake and eating it
48,after all a fantasy that includes angels witches embodied souls and the possibility of movement between parallel worlds is hardly a secular universe
49,this is still a childrens book and it retains comforting childish elements - so it can alleviate the dreariness of rationalism with magic flowers and talking bears
50,nevertheless its fascinating that such a book has found such an audience now
51,we have all learnt not to ask writers to give us any moral messages
52,with most literature that works perfectly because it makes us alive to irony and imagination without boxing the work up with moral preconceptions
53,but pullman is actually asking his readers to engage with him ethically as well as imaginatively
54,he says wonderfully old-fashioned things like blake once wrote of milton that he was of the devils party without knowing it
55,i am of the devils party and i know it
56,pullman celebrates beliefs that should be central to the world we want to build now - beliefs in equal sexual love in suspicion of authority in free thought and in a connection with the environment
57,his sales and reputation suggest that many readers are absolutely entranced by fiction that can mint such brilliant coinage from the dusty moral currency of our age
58,and even those people who deplore the so-called infantilisation of adult culture would go a long way to find anything else that has such power to make us think and wonder
59,open a kitchen drawer in any home and they will spring out at you like a jack- in-the-box.
60,go to any beauty spot and you are sure to encounter a few trapped among the plants like giant insects or flapping noisily in the wind
61,floating in the local river or blocking your nearest storm drain plastic carrier bags are an unsightly and environmentally degrading fact of modern life
62,the irish government took action yesterday imposing a tax of 15 cents 9p - dubbed the 'plastax' - on single-use plastic shopping bags payable by the shopper not the shop
63,in britain supermarkets were considering whether the green levy might eventually cross the irish sea
64,environmentalists meanwhile were estimating how far the annual consumption of 12 billion bags would fall if it did - and whether shoppers might change their habits if they had to pay for the environmental consequences of their actions
65,the notion was given a tentative thumbs-up last night by the secretary of state for the environment margaret beckett after a meeting in brussels with her european counterparts
66,its an interesting idea she said.
67,we are in close touch with our irish colleagues on environmental issues and though its not something we have in mind we will watch the results of the irish initiative with interest
68,there is no doubt that the irish republic has a problem with plastic bags
69,the idea of a surcharge on every carrier bag whether given away or sold was first floated in 1999 but it has taken until now to implement
70,even this introduction was delayed from 1 january because the government feared that bringing in such a measure and the euro on the same day would be too much for irelands consumers to cope with
71,irelands bag tax is expected to raise more than 100m annually which will be channelled into environmental schemes
72,but bobby malloy the environment minister who first suggested the idea was clear about its aims
73,he said yesterday the primary purpose of this levy is not to generate revenue but to change consumer behaviour
74,i want to see a significant reduction in the use of plastic shopping bags and a subsequent reduction in the number of bags that end up as litter
75,the only exemption in irelands shops and supermarkets are the so-called bags for life sold by many supermarkets for the equivalent of 10p which are replaced for free when they wear out
76,indeed many irish supermarkets reported a brisk trade in these last weekend
77,on this side of the irish sea a number of groups are watching developments closely
78,the environmental group friends of the earth believes it could be significant
79,foe spokesman mike childs said innovations like this will hopefully focus peoples mind on reusing plastic bags and reduce the amount of unnecessary waste that is so easily created
80,we will follow its effectiveness with great interest
81,it might seem obvious that if you charge people for something which they used to get free they will use it less
82,the same logic underpins the proposals made a week ago by the commission for integrated transport to charge british drivers not for car ownership or petrol use but by road usage based on demand
83,plastic bags can be recycled but only about 0.5 per cent ever are despite schemes such as that operated by sainsburys which gives a 1p refund for every bag that is reused
84,shredded and compacted they can also be used as bedding for roads and in the construction of buildings
85,yet plastic bags represent only one part of the complex overall waste problem according to both environmental groups and those who make the bags
86,at the british plastics federation the watchword is restraint
87,"the bpf's senior adviser on industrial issues marcia gick, said a survey in australia found that cigarette butts caused four times more litter than plastic bags"
88,the survey was done by weight
89,and she added the irish have a very different problem from us in the united kingdom
90,they have a large rural population and a very bad record on waste collection and disposal
91,the irish counterpart of the bpf lobbied unsuccessfully of course against the plastax.
92,now the bpf must consider whether it might arrive here - although ms gick is quite confident that it will not
93,the only other european state which taxes plastic bags is denmark which has a tax on all packaging - and a similar problem to that of ireland with a big rural population and not enough recycling
94,and there have been complaints from other european union states that the tax creates a distortion in the market and so is against eu rules
95,however european states have found a variety of ways to encourage recycling
96,in belgium supermarkets encourage re-use of their carrier bags by crediting shoppers with points on their loyalty cards
97,in finland supermarkets pay a levy on the amount of plastic bags used with the proceeds funding recycling
98,germany has been making advances in recycling for years
99,in 1991 store chains there were ordered to pay a levy to a recycling company in return displaying the gruner punkt green dot on their products
100,plastic bags have to be bought at the checkout for about 30p though environmentally-friendly shoppers prefer cloth or wicker bags
101,the dutch are keen on recycling their carrier bags
102,they incinerate the bags in accordance with strict environmental rules and use the resulting energy to heat hospitals
103,other states such as portugal and greece are like ireland laggards in the recycling stakes
104,for members of the bpf any tax on carrier bags is sure to be bad news
105,but environmental groups feel that they are absolutely the way to go - setting up the way for a radical clash of objectives in the years ahead
106,in fact for mr childs at friends of the earth taxing plastic bags barely begins to scratch the surface of the problem - which in britain is huge but largely hidden from our daily sight just as we tuck those bags away in kitchen cupboards and drawers
107,the problem is this by 2020 according to an eu directive that the uk has agreed to we must only send one-third of our waste to landfill
108,that means either recycling or incinerating the other two-thirds or since landfill space is running out especially in the south-east even more
109,but incinerators are unpopular at least with the people who have to live near them
110,so the answer is to recycle
111,and britons do far too little of that
112,our fear is that governments put forward ideas for problems which are high-profile but arent part of a decent waste recycling strategy said mr childs
113,the irish we hear want to burn all their waste to meet the 2020 directive - so we think that this plastax is more like a diversion from what needs to be done and from their dirty waste disposal schemes
114,and if you look at how much it would actually cost to introduce here - you would have loads of civil service time taken up with consulting with shops and then drafting legislation and then with chasing shops to see how many plastic bags had been sold
115,the plastax might actually turn out to be a profitable scheme for unscrupulous shopkeepers - which will keep the irish customs & excise on its mettle
116,so what is the real solution
117,friends of the earth say it is much closer to home than the checkouts ensure that every household has access to a quality doorstep recycling scheme
118,at present we recycle 11 per cent of our household waste
119,while that has increased from 8 per cent a few years ago it is still a long way from the 66 per cent needed
120,without decent recycling facilities people across the uk will continue living next door to polluting incinerators and filthy landfills says mr childs
121,then you could charge people for the household waste that they dont recycle
122,that has been introduced in the us and canada and has been very effective in getting people to cut down on their rubbish
123,it encourages people to think more before they buy stuff with lots of packaging
124,thats what we really need in this culture
125,the decision of the human fertility and embryology authority hfea to allow a couple to select genetically their next baby was bound to raise concerns that advances in biotechnology are racing ahead of our ability to control the consequences
126,the couple at the centre of this case have a son who suffers from a potentially fatal disorder and whose best hope is a marrow transplant from a sibling so the stakes of this decision are particularly high
127,the hfea's critics believe that it sanctions designer babies and does not show respect for the sanctity of individual life
128,certainly the authority's backing for shahana and raj hashmi's plea for genetic screening raises fundamental questions about producing one human being to cure anothers disease
129,but the parents view is simple and compelling
130,the ivf treatment is available to help produce a baby whose tissue will match his or her elder brothers bone marrow
131,they require as mrs hashmi puts it a helping hand from the hfea
132,screening for genetic disorders has been permissible for some time
133,those who oppose the treatment on grounds that it echoes destructive eugenics programmes have misplaced their concern
134,the use of such techniques to weed out genes that might result in a disability does not suggest that disabled people are defective
135,it merely uses progress to prevent a malfunction of nature
136,they would not reject medical intervention to put right other things that go wrong with the body
137,yet they ask that mankind pass up the chance to use scientific advances in biotechnology to prevent unnecessary suffering
138,the inconsistency is striking and would be cruel if it were allowed to impede a beneficial solution
139,the hfea already backed type screening in principle in december
140,this latest move is a logical advance
141,we can welcome that and still accept the need to maintain the distinction between these and more frivolous or dubious reasons why parents might want to opt for genetic pre-selection
142,that is why it is also right that the hfea continues to reject genetic pre-selection if it helps parents choose gender let alone more superficial preferences for a certain appearance
143,grounds of pure preference are not enough to make parental choice paramount and the authority should resist pressure to give in on this point
144,the hashmis' aim is very different
145,they are concerned with saving a life as well as creating one
146,they and their doctors may reject other embryos as imperfect matches but they are not selecting their baby as if it were a designer coat or handbag
147,this is a clear case of maximising benefits and minimising harm
148,the parents want another child and their existing son will be the beneficiary
149,critics of such technology warn that the child is to be used as a means rather than an end in itself
150,instead of being valued for his or her own sake they say the next hashmi babys raison d'�tre will be his life-saving qualities
151,yet in wanting their child to serve a certain purpose this couple is merely following in the footsteps of countless couples before them couples who have wanted a child to boost their own relationship or provide their first-born with a sibling
152,the hashmis' decision is like that of any other couple who want the best for their child
153,shahana and raj hashmi will undoubtedly love their next baby as much as their first
154,as david beckham discovered to his cost the manager of manchester united likes to have the last word
155,which is why hes signed up for another 3 years and 11m
156,one of the defining moments of sir alex fergusons glorious but often contentious career as manager of manchester united came in february 2000 when david beckham his star player failed to report for training
157,beckham said his baby son was ill and that he needed to be at home with him
158,fair enough
159,but when ferguson discovered that beckhams wife victoria was out shopping at the time he hit the roof
160,according to someone who knows him well the publicity machine that surrounds the beckhams has always been intensely irritating to him
161,now by his lights beckham was letting the side down and in fergusons book there is no greater sin
162,for the next match beckham was kicked out of the team
163,he wasnt even a substitute
164,it seemed unthinkable to drop beckham - to put a personal squabble as some saw it before the interests of the team
165,but ferguson had done it
166,what the incident really betrayed was a clash of cultures - a 21st-century man touchy-feeliness on the one hand and on the other the hard mans world that shaped ferguson growing up among the scottish working class in the 1950s
167,it certainly wasnt one in which wives have the definitive say in their husbands lives which is ironic in the light of what lay behind last weeks news that far from retiring at the end of this season as had previously been announced ferguson will remain at old trafford for another three years
168,though no great lover of the game fergusons wife cathy knew what it meant to him and could still mean and she perhaps didnt relish the prospect of having this great brooding figure about the house with no outlet for his footballing energies
169,no matter that he has achieved everything at united - the european cup seven premier league titles four fa cups and one league cup - or that he turned 60 at the end of 2001
170,cathy ferguson could see that there was plenty left in him and her intervention was crucial
171,why not carry on
172,as cathy says retire when you feel tired ferguson said last week
173,and i feel strong young and fit
174,family has always been important to ferguson and so by extension have the wider roots of his upbringing
175,"in his case that was govan the clydeside district on the south-western edge of glasgow where his father alex snr was one of 100,000 or so men who built ships"
176,the sense of community in which ferguson grew up was palpable and as a young toolmaker in a glasgow factory he was soon involved in the union
177,full-time professional football did not come until he was 22 when he joined dunfermline
178,spells at three other clubs followed
179,he ran a pub in glasgow before taking up his first managerial post at st mirren
180,but it was as the manager of aberdeen from 1978 to 1986 that ferguson made his mark breaking the hold over scottish football enjoyed by rangers and celtic before moving to manchester
181,united was a club on which the past bore down
182,with both the munich air disaster of 1958 and the triumphs of the late 1960s it had a unique legacy that it was struggling to live up to
183,since the retirement in 1971 of the great sir matt busby a succession of managers had come and gone with little to show
184,would ferguson do any better
185,in the early years it was touch and go whether he would survive
186,but he bought some time by winning the fa cup in 1990 and the elusive championship the clubs first for 26 years finally arrived in 1993 in the inaugural premier league season
187,since then united have been almost unstoppable as both a footballing and a commercial force
188,fergusons achievement has been to withstand the pressure that goes with running the worlds biggest club and at the same time maintain the attacking tradition of the united sides of old
189,even uniteds detractors - the club is fiercely resented for its stranglehold on the english game - have to admit that under ferguson domestic football has been raised to breathtaking new levels
190,if such erudite continentals as the england manager sven goran eriksson and ars�ne wenger of arsenal seem to represent a new studiousness in football then ferguson might be seen as a throwback to an age when the sort of men to whom he is heir - tough scots such as bill shankly and jock stein - seethed with a passion for the game and exuded a sometimes terrifying authority
191,but you dont get to be the towering figure that ferguson has become without the shrewdness attention to detail and profound understanding of players personalities which no powers of intimidation can make up for
192,its just that unlike eriksson and wenger ferguson has been known to go into rages in which tables have been kicked and teacups thrown
193,theres a difference between old-style and old-fashioned says alastair campbell the downing street press chief who has welcomed ferguson as a staunch labour supporter
194,yes hes old- style in that hes disciplined and he leads from the top
195,but what people perhaps dont understand about alex is that he has an incredibly acute intelligence
196,he was one of the first to appreciate the importance of diet and training regimes for players
197,at the same time he understands that united is a huge business
198,id say all that puts him in the new manager mould
199,few managers form bonds with players as ferguson does
200,he has regarded the welsh winger ryan giggs almost as a son ever since he broke into the team as a gifted 17-year-old
201,in roy keane uniteds irresistible irish midfielder ferguson sees many of his own formidable qualities
202,and with eric cantona peter schmeichel and now the brilliant dutch striker ruud van nistelrooy ferguson has found his faith in individual genius with all its attendant pitfalls spectacularly rewarded
203,fergusons probably the last manager who can use fear as a weapon to deal with players says the sportswriter ken jones
204,thats very difficult today because the players have so much money that they can just turn round and tell you where to go
205,when loyalty to players is not returned ferguson does not easily forgive
206,likewise when he feels press criticism is unjustified
207,this season has seen a low point in his often turbulent relationship with reporters with ferguson cancelling press conferences and haranguing people when he does agree to turn up
208,one of fergusons three sons jason is also his agent and the questions raised about this arrangement have seriously rankled with him
209,does ferguson bear grudges
210,its more that he always has to have the last word says someone close to him
211,of course he has mellowed over the years
212,as the owner of some top-class horses he derives huge pleasure from racing often turning up on the gallops early in the morning after a match the night before
213,there was a time when he felt undervalued at united
214,what mattered to him about the big pay increase he secured a few years ago was not what it could buy him but what it said about his worth
215,at 11m over three years fergusons new contract makes him comfortably britains highest paid manager
216,by the crazy standards of the footballing economy it is money well spent
217,it is just a week since the independent on sunday launched its asthma campaign and already ministers have begun to take action
218,shrugging off their officials instinct to try to kick the issue into the long grass both michael meacher the environment minister and yvette cooper the public health minister have immediately appreciated its importance
219,both have referred the scientific studies revealed in this newspaper that indicate that traffic fumes can cause asthma to the official committee on the medical effects of air pollution
220,tomorrow mr meacher will press his european ministerial colleagues to impose tougher continent-wide controls on ozone one of the main pollutants involved
221,and ms cooper is to send new guidance to doctors on tackling the growing epidemic of the disease in children
222,this is good as far as it goes and the ministers - two of the best in a not overtalented government - are to be commended for thinking out of the bureaucratic box
223,but it is only a small start and will take time to make a difference
224,the pollution committee does not meet until june
225,the new health guidelines will take two years to produce
226,and brussels notoriously moves at the pace of the snails so delectably served up in the citys restaurants
227,the urgency of the crisis blighting the lives of one in every seven british children - and their families - requires a much faster response
228,it also demands a more far-reaching one
229,our report today that two-thirds of british schools fail to help their asthmatic pupils and that hundreds of thousands of sufferers are not properly informed about their condition show how shamefully the departments of health and education have neglected the epidemic
230,meanwhile the department of transport - at mr blairs specific backseat instruction - is driving policy in the wrong direction towards more roads more cars more pollution and more asthma
231,the prime minister and the cabinet ministers in charge of the relevant departments must take on the issue themselves and institute wholesale changes in policy - or take the blame for continuing child illness and death
232,the difference between dial-up internet access and a high-speed service that is permanently on is akin to that between a horse-drawn cart and a car which is why there is usually no going back for people who have graduated from one to the other
233,so it would be churlish not to applaud the sharp price reduction announced yesterday by bt for its broadband service
234,assuming that the internet service providers pass on most of the cut an average monthly subscription should come down to around 25 from the 40 or so it currently costs
235,this is by any measure a swingeing cut and makes broadband service in britain as reasonably priced if not cheaper than its equivalent elsewhere in the world
236,whether it will be enough to persuade britons to sign up for the broadband revolution with as much alacrity as americans or our fellow- europeans however is another matter
237,"germany already has 2 million subscribers britain fewer than 150,000."
238,the wonders of broadband are not at issue
239,the technology allows the same line to be used for internet access and telephone calls without either capability blocking the other
240,it enables audio and video files to be transferred almost instantaneously
241,whole films can be delivered in minutes
242,so why has britain been so comparatively slow to adopt the new technology
243,the accepted thesis is that high prices have are the main deterrent
244,certainly 40 a month is steep and those cable companies that supply high-speed internet access have already attracted more subscribers than bt with monthly payments set at 25
245,but that is still double the price of many dial-up subscriptions
246,and for home rather than professional use dial-up access is adequate
247,the price cuts announced by bt mean that the theory of price as the chief obstacle to wider take-up will now be tested
248,in fact consumer resistance may lie elsewhere
249,even if the price of fast internet access is going down the price of computers remains static
250,and as with mobile phones there may be a limit to the range of services that people need or want from computers
251,if they are to conquer the mass market bt and the internet service providers must work harder to convince people that their most hi-tech services are not only competitively priced but relevant to their lives
252,tony blair is engaged in low politics on fox-hunting
253,the timing of this his third initiative seems to have been influenced by the need to get stephen byers through his trial by ordeal in the house of commons on tuesday
254,not only did it reward labour backbenchers for their show of loyalty but it helped move the media caravan on from the semantics of lying by presenting them with a new - or rather renewed - controversy
255,however labour backbenchers are not so stupid that they can be bought off with yet another meaningless vote that allows them to express their opinions and is then forgotten
256,equally public opinion which on this issue is wrong but unmistakable would not easily understand another marching of the abolitionist troops up the hill only for them to be marched down again
257,most people think that hunting with dogs is cruel that it should be banned and that the government should get on with it
258,the real low politics of mr blairs return to this subject therefore is that of reaching a compromise with the house of lords
259,whatever the presentational value with his own party of occasional confrontations with the forces of conservatism in red coats and on horseback the prime minister is unlikely to want to provoke another full-dress showdown with the countryside lobby
260,the last time he picked a fight with them the deputy prime minister and a protester had to be prised apart in a bed in rhyl in the middle of a general election campaign
261,on 18 march the commons will undoubtedly vote overwhelmingly again for a complete ban on hunting
262,if left to themselves the lords would just as overwhelmingly vote to leave things as they are
263,mr blair may hope that the threat of the parliament act - which requires the will of the commons ultimately to prevail over that of the upper house - will encourage the lords to opt for the compromise instead
264,getting the lords to decide that the middle way compromise scheme is the lesser of two evils depends however on the credibility of the threat to use the parliament act
265,the lords could call mr blairs bluff if they judge that he really would not want to have the so-called countryside march on whitehall again
266,this is no way to decide an issue of principle
267,the majority of people in britain confuse their distaste for a minority pursuit with the instinct that there ought to be a law against it
268,there should not be just as there should be no law against the rather more popular sport of angling
269,the undue attention devoted to one particular means of culling animals owes too much to the perceived class connotations of country sports and sanctimony about humans deriving pleasure from it
270,what requires legislation is the less visible cruelty towards farmed chickens and pigs and towards other animals in transit not to mention cruel and unnecessary experiments on primates
271,a compromise between a ban on hunting and no ban is dishonest
272,the idea of licensed or regulated cruelty makes no sense
273,it would be better if the prime minister and all those mps who vote for a ban simply to earn easy applause from a vocal and passionate minority of their constituents were courageous enough to explain to the voters that while some activities may offend our sensibilities they should not all be banned
274,the middle way is a classic blairite fudge
275,it is unlikely to satisfy either side - although the hunters are likely to be the more disappointed because hunting would continue with only some of its more repellent excesses curtailed
276,the prime minister would earn a great deal more respect if he said what he really thought and explained and defended that instead of trying to fix his way out of a political problem
277,today in the european parliaments chamber in brussels 105 men and women from 28 european nations will gather to begin discussing a constitutional settlement for europe
278,europe has a constitution now of course but in its various official languages it runs into literally millions of pages of legislation council decisions and commission directives known collectively as the acquis - not exactly a household term in europes salons and saunas
279,this tangle of laws and regulations has long cried out to be formulated into a few simple rules with the paramount aim of bringing europe closer to its people as the jargon goes
280,"the question is whether the constitutional convention now assembled under the leadership of the former french president val�ry giscard d'estaing, is an appropriate vehicle to deliver a new constitutional settlement"
281,certainly the choice of mr giscard to run things doesnt inspire a great deal of confidence
282,the fact that he is old should be no obstacle although his slightly sleazy past remember the bokassa diamonds scandal
283,detracts a little from his dignity
284,"the more serious drawback with mr giscard is simply the suspicion that he will guide the convention in a direction that reflects the traditional french approach to governance - not so much libert fraternit�, egalit� as �litisme, dirigisme technocratie."
285,that trinity was in fact very much the foundation of the institutions of the original european community as set out in the treaty of rome of 1957
286,it was the vision of jean monnet and robert schumann the french founding fathers of the community and of the comit d'action pour les unis d'europe that they founded
287,these arrangements worked well for the small community of the six but in a union of 15 they are distinctly creaky
288,all agree that in a union of 25 or 30 - the position we could easily be in before the decade is out - such arrangements would be unsustainable
289,the danger is that mr giscard a typical product of the french lite will simply want to give us more of the same but with a much stronger centre
290,that would mean a stronger commission and a leadership role for the big five france the uk germany italy and spain to cope with the demands of a state union
291,indeed worries about expansion leading to a wider but looser eu underlay the french governments past resistance to welcoming new members from scandinavia and the east
292,still there are reasons to be optimistic
293,mr giscard will not be able to have things all his own way in a 105-member commission especially as the british are providing its chief executive in the form of sir john kerr a supermandarin and diplomat
294,and the laeken declaration that set up the convention declared that european institutions must be brought closer to citizens
295,they want them to be less unwieldy and more efficient and open
296,that cannot be ignored
297,by far the best way of ensuring that europe is brought closer to its people is to provide for a stronger european parliament
298,until that is done there is very little chance of a truly pan-european party system developing and with that a european level of debate
299,more sessions of the european council should be open to the cameras and the public
300,and most importantly there should be a much stronger formal commitment to the principle of subsidiarity with more decision-making devolved to national regional and local levels
301,more than ever in a union of 30 states europe should concentrate on performing the tasks - in the economic environmental and even defence fields - where it can make a difference
302,surely mr giscard has to understand that
303,the prospect of meeting an old but separated schoolfriend can trigger far more fear than joy
304,did the charismatic soul who thrilled your teenage self evolve into a bore a prig an oaf
305,worse did they never possess the virtues you innocently pinned to them
306,what applies to people applies in spades to literature
307,to re-read a favourite author of ones youth is to court incredulity and even self-disgust.
308,how could i have rated that pretentious garbage/sentimental schlock
309,around the age of 15 i adored john steinbeck's the grapes of wrath almost more than any other novel
310,soon enough i learnt this was an inadmissible affection
311,too folksy too naturalistic stylistically immature politically nave the hit squads of academic criticism had dropped down hard on steinbeck even before his death in 1968
312,he was born - in salinas california - on 27 february 1902 and next week allen lane publishes an ample selection of his non-fiction to mark the centenary of men and their making edited by susan shillinglaw and jackson j benson 25
313,of course i opened it with trepidation
314,would steinbeck prove as cringingly embarrassing as every other 15-year-old crush
315,i need not have worried
316,of men and their making is a constant delight a generous hearted vaudeville show of a book that switches from elegantly crafted memoirs to frivolous pieces on fishing or fords from thrilling reportage to sinewy meditations on politics and culture
317,not all of it is perfect or profound
318,steinbeck wrote reams of journalism over three decades and one leading item on the academic sheet states that he squandered too much talent on ephemera
319,but all in all his praise for mark twain's incredible ear and eye and sense of form as a subjective observer goes for steinbeck too
320,here is the democratic american voice in all its glory friendly courageous compassionate keen to go everywhere see everything and capture it all in pacy spirited prose that can swing between high ideas and street life without missing a beat
321,the collection teems with hundreds of images and phrases that kick and bite and stay - from the childhood memory of a phonograph that leaped from a shelf and destroyed itself in the california earthquake of 1906 to the vision of bob hope in london in 1943 wisecracking to a hospital ward of maimed soldiers and magically drawing laughter up out of the black water
322,we revisit the evoked california towns of steinbeck's youth and we follow him into the itinerant workers camps of the dust bowl years in articles that mount a ringing defence of the dignity of economic migrants
323,the editors choose some grittily memorable wartime reportage some charming accounts of postwar europe and portraits of his friends from woody guthrie and robert capa to henry fonda
324,watching john fords fine film of the grapes of wrath after 20 years steinbeck is galvanised when this lean stringy faced piece of electricity walked out on the screen
325,even the 1966 text of a photo book on america and americans written when he had allegedly gone soft is typically abrasive about his countrymen's taste for narcissism and racism from the first we have treated our minorities abominably the way the old boys do the new kids in school
326,steinbeck was not always prescient like many other us liberals he supported the early stages of the war in vietnam
327,yet these 400 pages rattle by without a snide thought a cheap shot or a dead sentence from beginning to end
328,at a time when establishment america takes on the sepulchral tones of donald rumsfeld or the silences of kenneth lay this book could achieve more for the nations prestige overseas than a hundred extra cia recruits
329,in the list of picture captions you never thought youd see in the pages of a serious newspaper old vomit is right up there with joan collins and her new husband also 68
330,but 160 million-year-old vomit was precisely the caption in tuesdays papers relating to the thrilling discovery of fossilised dinosaur puke in a clay quarry near peterborough
331,lets leave to the panellists of have i got news for you the cheap gibe that the daily telegraph - with a substantial number of fossils and dinosaurs among its readers - was stirring nostalgia rather than publishing bona fide news
332,instead lets consider what a fabulous discovery this is beyond even steven spielberg's wildest dreams
333,professor peter doyle of the university of greenwich believes that the fossils found near peterborough are digested shellfish regurgitated by ichthyosaurs marine reptiles
334,how he reached this conclusion is not the business of this column thank god not of course that the almighty has any place in palaeontology
335,but it is certainly interesting to dwell on the significance of his conclusion
336,for one thing it heaps enviable prestige upon peterborough which until this week had only its handsome norman cathedral to boast about
337,but there arent too many places in the world able to demonstrate proof that an ichthyosaur once chundered somewhere in the vicinity
338,thinking about it though it is quite possible that the people of peterborough would rather not adopt this as a claim to fame just as the townsfolk of slough tend not to put it about that john betjeman once wrote a poem about them
339,as for the vomiting side of the equation i dont know if you've noticed but up has been looming large in popular culture
340,billy connolly was one of the first to draw attention to it wondering why drunkards being sick call so despairingly for ralph and huey
341,and although vomiting was one of the last human bodily functions to get a regular airing on television rare is the drama now that does not feature at least one person spewing into a toilet
342,certainly no self-respecting soap lets new years eve go without a character chucking up after too much alcohol we have even had animated vomit on the simpsons
343,i mention this because until now palaeontology has rubbed shoulders with popular culture only in the bbc series walking with dinosaurs - which as brilliant as it was tended to drag once youd marvelled at the special effects for long enough - and in the irritating form of ross in the sitcom friends
344,but professor doyles discovery changes everything
345,i have a six-year-old son who knows the difference between a protoceratops and a diplodocus like he knows the difference between baked beans and strawberry jam
346,however he has been to the natural history museum dozens of times and it no longer lights his fire
347,when i told him about the ichthyosaur dashing parts of cambridgeshire with shellfish however he was all ears
348,he was plainly enthralled by the idea that anything jurassic might behave in the same way as he did the other night after a tummy bug brought up his spaghetti bolognese
349,might behave better still like bart simpson
350,what is needed now is for an enterprising childrens telly producer perhaps the person behind that sickeningly cute dinosaur barney to make a show about twin ichthyosaurs called ralph and huey
351,and the thought also occurs that some graduate student might want to consider a thesis on the enthralling history of vomit
352,"i was once shown round a vomitorium, where middle-class romans went to bring back their dinners"
353,it was fascinating
354,but i cant for the life of me remember where it was
355,for peterborough's sake not there i hope
356,when i was about 20 i worked in an office
357,every morning there would be that little joke where anyone who arrived five minutes late would say morning and everyone would call back afternoon
358,the next joke would come at about 11 when the boss would take his coffee cup across to the sink to rinse it out
359,every day hed say just going off to wash my thing - ha ha ha
360,and every day i wished i had the guts to wait five minutes say just going off to wash my thing then walk to the sink get my knob out and scrub it with a dishcloth
361,like most office workers i never had any idea of the purpose of my office though the supervisor does his best to make out the job is extremely important when you first get there
362,well its a pleasure to have you with us as a vital part of the team
363,youll be sitting here with harold and every morning the newspapers will be delivered to your desk here
364,now your job is to go through all those newspapers one by one very carefully indeed and colour in the os
365,be very careful not to do the noughts in the sports pages and when you've finished hand them across to harold for authorisation
366,and poor harold whos been there 54 years will say cor blimey its like a madhouse in here sometimes
367,we were in here until 20 past seven one night you know
368,the evening newspaper had a big article about yoko ono going up the orinoco you see
369,recently for the first time since ive been commuting to an office again and i realise that id forgotten the most important aspect of the whole business
370,it starts with getting the train which has been at least 10 minutes late every day except once
371,but a new trick has been added
372,at london victoria the underground gets so crowded that a giant yellow light flashes and a siren wails with the sort of noise youd expect to hear if aliens invaded
373,then a huge metal shutter is drawn across the entrance to stop anyone getting in for up to 20 minutes and a crowd of several hundred builds up
374,one morning someone lost it as if it was a trench in the first world war and yelled thats it im going in
375,and squeezed round the gap to charge through a line of security guards and make a break for it
376,it felt like the rest of us should shout oh my god tommy's cracked and the fool hes going over the top
377,instead it was more like invasion of the body snatchers with the rest of us thinking dont fight it
378,be like us and accept it then theres no more pain just a numbness thats quite pleasant once youre used to it
379,and that way you become a commuter each days journey indistinguishable from the next so that you notice the tiniest differences
380,aha i thought one day i must be slightly later than yesterday because the busker is at the end of hotel california whereas most days shes only just started
381,but some things are different from before
382,to get into this office involves a series of checks guards and style bag searches that make you wonder whether you've come to an underground military centre to work on a secret spaceship
383,i saw someone who'd worked there 10 years being searched to see if they were carrying any forks because we have to be careful since 11 september
384,because you cant be sure that a middle manager hasnt been playing a long game slowly getting themselves promoted to reach a position where they could run amok with a fork in revenge for the israeli occupation of the west bank
385,not only that but in order to repeat the havoc of 11 september this unlikely operative of the berkshire faction of al-qaida would need to have perfected the technique of getting offices to fly
386,besides which inside the building is a huge canteen containing about fifty million forks
387,once inside nothing can be done without a note or a permit or a laminated card
388,"a memo came round one morning to tell us that today between noon and one o'clock, you will receive a visit from the internal window cleaner"
389,you start to worry about saying im just nipping to the toilet in case someone in authority says first youll need to go to the fourth floor and visit the slash department to get your khazi warrant validated
390,in some ways office work is as ridden as anything from the 19th-century because its main purpose appears to be to wreck your self-esteem
391,the worst thing about spending all day being shunted from broken-down train to overcrowded tube to bureaucratic metropolis is how it makes you feel utterly worthless
392,it makes you wonder whether sheep were originally super-intelligent creatures who ruled the world but after a few centuries of being herded across fields in groups of several hundred one by one they all gave up and thought oh sod it i might as well stare in a gormless trance until someone mercifully sticks me in a stew
393,if hell does exist i think it almost certainly contains a corner devoted to pointless discussions
394,under satanic coercion the damned will be obliged to sit for eternity discussing whether nature is more important than nurture or whether screen violence leads to imitative behaviour
395,and if you've behaved with particular vileness you will be forced to join the endless debate about the state of the british film industry
396,quite a few people will be doing this voluntarily this week - provoked by the bafta shortlist of nominations for best british film which this year includes some titles that seem to stretch the definition a little
397,chris columbus's harry potter and robert altman's gosford park are packed with british a-list talent but both are directed by americans and financed almost entirely with american money
398,surely the sceptics will say this is the kind of grab raid that the best british film category was designed to prevent
399,the award has always had a smack of the consolation prize - as if it were one of those tried jolly hard stickers that the more anxious schools give out on sports day so that slow boys arent discouraged
400,but whats the point of cordoning off a section of the trophy table if hollywood can just lean over and rake in the cups
401,baftas definition of britishness turns out to be pretty straightforward
402,if you qualify for government tax relief as a british film then you qualify for this section
403,since the rules are that a film only counts as british if more than 70 per cent of its budget is spent in the united kingdom and more than 70 per cent of the payroll goes to european and commonwealth talent you can see that theres a concept of nationality here that is more all-embracing than that generally adopted by the uk immigration service
404,but baftas approach to this matter strikes me as perfectly sensible - or at least properly insouciant about an essentially trivial matter
405,besides there really isnt a workable alternative
406,while there might be a popular prejudice in favour of the who pays the piper approach to establishing national pedigree if the americans foot the bill then its an american movie it very quickly runs into trouble
407,bridget jones's diary for instance could credibly be claimed as a french movie by those lights since a large chunk of money came from studio canal
408,follow the money and you could claim that peter greenaway makes dutch movies and ken loach spanish ones
409,it doesnt help to call for the travel documents of the producer or director either
410,is black hawk down a british film simply because ridley scott can walk through the fast track at heathrow passport control
411,or should a room with a view be regarded as quintessentially indo-american because its producer ismail merchant comes from bombay and its director james ivory from new york
412,more importantly who cares apart from the production accountants who must squeeze every last drop out of the smallprint?
413,the truth is that the patrimony of a film - amorphous and debatable -- is probably the least interesting thing about it
414,cinema has always been a medium that thrived on the genius of immigrants - in this country as much as in america
415,what would hollywood have been without schmuel gelbfisch the young polish boy who later adopted the fabulously aspirational name sam goldwyn
416,what would british cinema be without korda and pressburger
417,to those questions we might legitimately add another one
418,what would american cinema be without the legions of british economic migrants and gastarbeiters who do their time in the hollywood hills
419,its time to recognise that britishness has been so successfully exported that britons can no longer claim a monopoly on its virtues
420,of late i have begun cutting my own hair
421,"before this up until a few months ago i would go perhaps twice a month to my barber gino of marchmont street london wc1, to have my hair trimmed by clippers on a no 1 setting with my beard cut slightly longer"
422,however for several years now gino's has been getting more and more popular
423,i dont know if this has anything to do with a number of extremely attractive women from around the world working there
424,is it a sort of timid mans lap dancing
425,i couldnt say
426,whatever the reason occasionally i would have to wait a long time before i would get to sit in the chair for the few minutes that it would take to have my own sparse bonce done
427,now i am an extremely busy man a popular and gregarious individual who is surrounded by a large and vibrant family who keep me on the go 236 as they say
428,the fact that just at this moment i am sitting alone in a dingy basement apartment the dank room lit by a single light bulb on the day after boxing day dining on some stale crackers and able to devote the whole day to writing 800 words to fill in for howard jacobson at a moments notice is merely a statistical anomaly
429,whatever i felt i didnt have the time to sit around waiting my turn so while i was in spain i purchased a set of electric clippers and set about myself in the bathroom
430,at first the result was a revelation to me as far as i could see my haircut was as good as i had been getting from the professionals over all these years
431,my god
432,i thought to myself ive been squandering seven pounds a month
433,not to mention all the effort id put in to walking painfully up and down marchmont street leaning on a zimmer frame to qualify for the oap discount now revealed as a terrible waste of time
434,my do-it-yourself haircut seemed to be a confirmation of an idea that had been at the back of my mind since the time i started losing my hair to pattern baldness
435,a bald man like me often harbours resentment about spending money on tonsorial elaboration since it appears an essentially pointless exercise
436,or sometimes we baldies can go the other way
437,for example there was a previous editor of this newspaper who was as bereft of hair as i yet who would visit the society trimmer trevor sorbie on average about once a week which - knowing the prices that sorbie charges - must have worked out at about 15 a hair
438,so now i thought i was saving myself both time and money
439,i had a neat haircut while freeing up the time i would have spent at the hair salon to do more important things like download different tones for my mobile from the internet and dribble spittle on the dining room table
440,yet after a few days something strange happened to my previously uniform haircut and i suspect this is where the skill of the professional hairdresser lies
441,where there seemed to be an evenly cropped skull there suddenly appeared clumps of ragged hair which i had missed when i had been peering in the mirror along with completely smooth irregularly shaped bald patches which took much longer to grow back than the surrounding hair bloody scars and cuts and long springy like black hairs that sprouted from the dome of my pate
442,and frankly god knows whats going on behind me.
443,the other day while i was walking past the dalston mosque in east london an angry crowd of worshippers began to form in my wake and a growing mob followed me for quite some distance muttering furious threats and imprecations until i was forced to jump on to a bus
444,piecing together what they shouted at me afterwards led me to believe that with my clippers and a wobbly hand i may inadvertently have carved various foul obscenities in arabic script onto the back of my skull
445,in the end i have nobody to blame but myself
446,i thought that i didnt need anybody else i thought i could do it for myself i was arrogant and vain and as a result i am now forced to go out only at night to slink through the streets of bloomsbury with my hideous visage covered by a long black hooded cloak
447,also since i have had time to dwell on it though i admit i am perhaps obsessed it strikes me that in the past few months isnt that in a way what the us has been doing - cutting its own hair
448,since september the us has in essence despite the convenient cloak of an alliance been acting on its own unilaterally with no recourse to the collective advice and wisdom of those who know a lot more about the situation than the us does or who will suffer the consequences of the uss actions
449,at the moment we are in the first days of the new haircut everything looks uniform and smart but in the coming months there is no knowing what strange lumps and excrescences will appear what bald patches or ugly springy hairs will sprout what obscenities will be written
450,or everything might turn out ok
451,the fast-food giant mcdonalds was taken to court yesterday by dozens of people who claim to have been scalded by their hot drinks
452,the 36 victims most of whom are children claim that the cups used by mcdonalds were not suitable and that the tea and coffee was too hot the high court heard
453,timothy horlock qc representing the group said children were particularly at risk from being scalded with at least 16 claimants aged four or under at the time of the accident
454,this is not surprising since according to the defendants own statistics 60 per cent of accidents to their customers happen to children under 10 mr horlock said.
455,he said the companys marketing strategy was designed to attract young customers
456,he said many people did not realise the drinks served at mcdonalds were often far hotter than at home
457,there was no expectation on the part of the general public that a burn from one of these drinks could result in injuries needing skin grafts mr horlock said.
458,mr horlock told the preliminary hearing that mcdonalds was aware of the danger and was negligent in not taking measures to protect its customers
459,he said the average temperature of drinks served in mcdonalds machines ranged from 75c to 90c.
460,mcdonalds is contesting the action
461,in 1994 it settled a case with a woman who claimed she suffered serious burns after spilling coffee bought from a mcdonalds in new mexico
462,"she was awarded 29m 2m by a jury which was reduced to $640,000 (�450,000) on appeal"
463,the hearing continues today
464,as ever market trends are against the way of life of a marginalised community
465,the evidence of the annual caravan show which opened in birmingham yesterday is that the traditional caravan the wheeled kitchenette that you attach to the back of a car is being ousted - much in the manner of red squirrels by grey - by the all-in-one mobile home
466,caravanners have been a despised minority for too long.
467,they may not have known quite how much they were despised by the drivers of unencumbered vehicles travelling behind their swaying boxes on a motorway but they sensed that they were discriminated against by the mainstream
468,and they knew that they were under-represented in parliament with only one of their number margaret beckett in the cabinet
469,mobile homes meanwhile have shaken off their image as overgrown camper vans and become fashionable with the help of air-conditioning built-in dishwashers and all mod cons.
470,surely owners should react by going in the opposite direction back to the simpler holiday life that is true to their origins
471,they could invent a more basic and portable form of accommodation
472,and call it a tent
473,noam chomsky one of americas leading philosophers and an icon of the radical left took centre stage in an istanbul court yesterday when a judge threw out charges against the turkish publisher of his book criticising treatment of the kurdish minority
474,bespectacled and mild-mannered mr chomsky cut an unlikely figure in the crowded courtroom where crimes against the state are tried
475,the 72-year-old linguistics professor watched as prosecutors abandoned earlier claims and accepted the defence argument that fatih tas of aram publishing had not spread separatist propaganda
476,the charge is often levelled at critics of turkeys policy towards its estimated 12 million kurds
477,"bekir rayif aldemir, the prosecutor said he understood the book did not seek to divide the turkish nation"
478,mr tas faced a year in prison for printing american interventionism a collection of mr chomsky's political essays in which he accuses turkey of brutal repression of the kurds
479,the prosecutor clearly made the right decision mr chomsky told reporters after the hearing
480,hopefully this will serve as a step for establishing freedom of speech in turkey
481,mr tas a 22-year-old university student has six other cases pending against him carrying a possible 24-year prison term all for printing articles or books dealing with the kurdish issue
482,he called yesterdays ruling insincere and suggested the presence of the professor from the massachusetts institute of technology had helped him escape a jail sentence
483,the case was dismissed but this is not a sincere verdict it was given because of mr chomsky's support he said.
484,no charges were filed against mr chomsky
485,defence lawyers had asked that he be included as a co-defendant but prosecutors declined
486,a vocal critic of us foreign policy mr chomsky said before the hearing that americans had a responsibility to monitor and protest against human rights abuses in turkey which is a close ally
487,when the united states provides 80 per cent of arms to turkey for the express purpose of carrying out repression that becomes my responsibility he said.
488,the timing of mr chomsky's arrival could not have been worse for turkey
489,just a few streets from the state security court where the hearing was held the turkish government was playing host to a high-profile international conference bringing together foreign ministers from islamic and european union countries
490,most of the allegations of human rights abuses in turkey stem from fighting between security forces and kurdish rebels seeking self-rule
491,"some 37,000 people have died in the conflict which began in 1984"
492,rebels declared a unilateral ceasefire after the 1999 capture of their leader abdullah ocalan and an atmosphere of relative peace now prevails
493,turkey has started phasing out emergency rule in the mainly kurdish regions
494,also in 1999 turkey became the first predominantly muslim nation to join the eus list of official candidates for membership
495,but the countrys poor human rights record and the refusal to grant its estimated 12 million kurds greater cultural rights are cited among the chief reasons why entry is continually delayed
496,earlier this month parliament passed a set of human rights reforms intended to help turkey meet eu standards
497,the authenticity of a national gallery rubens has been called into question again
498,the last time samson and delilah was auctioned two decades ago it was the second most expensive painting ever sold
499,that must mean something
500,so apart from the millions of pounds involved and the reputation of our best art historians critics and academics - in what way if any does it matter
501,if the most educated experts cant tell for certain whether or not the things a rubens why should we proles worry
502,what does it lack this almost perfect copy or fake or homage or brilliant pupils effort
503,whats the difference
504,whats the difference indeed between a perfect copy and its original
505,and what else are monday mornings for than to consider the nature and value of art
506,first it must be said perfect copies of oil paintings are impossible
507,your old masters are just too peculiar
508,i dont believe much about art but i do believe that
509,it became clear for me at a frick exhibition of rembrandt self- portraits
510,we were kept back from the canvasses by a red rope a couple of feet from the wall
511,you could lean in and inspect the paint as close as you liked limited only by the length of your nose
512,and in doing so something very odd happened
513,rembrandts eye which had been so eloquent so real such a representation of a real eye disappeared when you saw it from four inches away
514,it only reappeared when you leant back an inch or so.
515,"you leant in and the eye exploded becoming a mess of specks slashes splashes splodges, spiral lines"
516,its components were chaotic
517,you leant back and there it was harmonious and full of meaning
518,well blank despair at any rate
519,there are more fakeable artists
520,in orson welles's film f for fake we saw the great forger elmyr de hory at the easel
521,casually in half-a-dozen brush strokes hed make a matisse and then throw it on the fire a chagall and throw it on the fire a picasso and throw it on the fire
522,acting in this capacity de hory was a marvellous craftsman rather than an artist but the product what was that
523,what effect would de hory's chagalls have had on gallery experts on connoisseurs on ravished collectors
524,in what way would the quality of their experience be different from that provided by the original
525,all the aesthetes who've sat in front of samson and delilah over the years working themselves up into a lather over the brushwork what will they say if and when rubens is declared innocent of the painting
526,they who have been moved who claim to have been changed how will they reconcile their new state to this betrayal
527,picasso regularly used to be to be asked to authenticate works that were sold as his
528,he always refused there are too many picassos around he said.
529,it depresses the price
530,one time he was told the piece hed condemned as a fake was indeed from his own hand
531,sometimes i fake picassos he said.
532,thats an interesting idea
533,when he imitates his own mannerisms he fakes himself
534,yes there is something in a masterpiece that speaks to us across the generations
535,the second- rate or the third-rate the brilliant copies and the awful fakes reveal themselves in time
536,a madonna and child forgery from the 1920s became obvious quite suddenly 50 years afterwards when the similarity between the madonna and clara bow was observed for the first time
537,it is one of those media friendly terms that covers up a multitude
538,alcohol- related illnesses
539,"this week we were told that these illnesses are in danger of destroying the nhs and are responsible for 33,000 deaths every year and that eight out of 10 people attending emergency units have alcohol related injuries"
540,in a society that encourages us to escape pain rather than face it alcohol is the favourite anaesthetic
541,"yet alcohol related illnesses doesnt have the oh my god scare-you-witless, fast resonance of a word such as cancer or leukaemia nor is it loaded with dread like the phrase sexually transmitted disease"
542,how many people hear alcohol-related illness and think of a sick head in the morning a transitory discomfort that will be gone by afternoon
543,before i get going let me enter an all too important caveat i am not remotely anti-booze.
544,god bless good wine and beer and whiskey beakers full of the warm south with beaded bubbles winking at the brim and purple stained mouth etc.
545,or as flann o'brien's poet of the people put it when eulogising guinness stout in the comic masterpiece at swim two birds when food is scarce and your larder bare and no rashers grease your pan a pint of plain is your only man
546,if you can drink and not succumb to one of those mysterious alcohol-related illnesses the best of luck to you
547,but if you are one of those whom booze seduces and then betrays if you spend your days and nights chasing the warm rainbow then this weeks news should be very scary indeed
548,are you the one in company who is watching the wine bottle and wondering whether the others will think it odd if you order another and then saying to hell with what they think
549,or the one who sees a friend leaving a glass of wine unfinished and wonders what in gods name is wrong with them
550,maybe you are the guy who wakes up and for a few terrifying minutes has no earthly idea where he is or what he did last night or the woman who rolls over and looks into the face of a stranger and wonders if she will be able to get up and get dressed and escape before they wake
551,and if you have known that morning where nothing lifts you - not beer or wine or whiskey - then alcohol-related illness is already with you
552,its screwing with your head and in time will get around to your body
553,that poor body
554,theres no end of misery that alcohol can bring
555,liver pancreas heart bowel slowly poisoned to death
556,thats usually well under way before the exterior starts falling apart before pissing blood and the yellow pallor and parchment skin before the amputated leg or the body immobilised by a stroke before the brain reduced to mush from all those tides of booze washing over it down the years
557,i have been to the funerals of many friends who have fallen into alcoholic death
558,it is never ever an easy death
559,scrub from your mind forever the notion of a romantic drunkards death disregard every admiring profile you read of the rebellious drunken singer/poet.
560,i read that rubbish and think of a man who choked to death on his own vomit a man who died of heart failure and wasnt found for a week the beautiful woman with an angels voice found bloated and poisoned on her kitchen floor a man who died far from those he loved in a small room in a town where nobody knew him
561,every one of them left people behind burdened with the question why
562,alcohol-related illnesses
563,if you have ever visited a hospital for alcoholics on a weekend when the kids are visiting youll have seen the illness in its saddest and most cruel form
564,take a lawn full of drunks and their families and contemplate the fact that at best only a quarter will recover from alcoholism
565,regard every alcohol-related illness as a huge stone cast into a small pond as a family broken and bewildered made sick too by the disease in its midst
566,i agree with alcohol concern there is no bigger health crisis facing britain
567,yet we remain curiously indifferent to the damage done to family life and the immense burden being placed on the health service
568,ask any recovering alcoholic and they gladly accept that responsibility for their sobriety is theirs alone
569,but that is the rationale of a person who has made the first vital step towards recognising that a problem exists
570,the first obstacle is the chronic denial around alcoholic illness
571,it is everywhere around us the elephant in the sitting room we refuse to acknowledge
572,hardly a family in the land is unaffected by the problem - most people know a cousin or a friend who battles with booze - yet there was a sense of shock when this weeks statistics were unveiled
573,it is difficult for families to face up to the issue in a society that is awash with denial
574,booze is embedded in our national rituals the socially acceptable drug
575,far easier to rave on about heroin and junkies than to face alcohol addiction
576,popular culture celebrates drunkenness for a good example of what i mean witness the moronic behaviour trotted out on itvs holiday reps programme each week
577,we ban cigarette advertising from television but allow the continued flogging of booze
578,we have alcohol drinks cynically aimed at the most vulnerable - i mean imagine the marketing strategy behind special brew
579,just who is the target market
580,i can think of two immediate candidates the young and the poor with little money who want to get pissed fast and the alcoholic chasing oblivion
581,when victims of alcohol abuse get sick they find a medical system woefully ill equipped to deal with the crisis
582,alcohol concern carried out a survey last august that found that 71 per cent of doctors and nurses interviewed felt they had insufficient information to help dependent drinkers
583,you might imagine that with alcohol costing the nhs 3bn a year politicians might express a sense of urgency
584,but like the rest of us they are cocooned in denial
585,this isnt a crisis that can be solved with drugs
586,they can help you out of detox but meaningful treatment depends on skilled counsellors
587,right now we have a chronic shortage of hospital places for those suffering from alcoholic illnesses
588,we dry out the drunks and put them back on the street and they come back again and again
589,many find their way into the criminal justice system
590,not just the street drunks banged away for being drunk and disorderly but also the businessmen and women hauled off to the cells because they've trashed the house or committed an assault the man who kills in the middle of a blackout
591,i normally rush for the door when i hear a politician or civil servant droning on about co-ordinated strategy
592,but the scale of damage being done by alcohol- related illness demands action across the widest range of areas
593,it means a huge increase in funding for alcoholism treatment and research and a willingness on the part of political leaders and the media to end the denial
594,we must talk about this stuff that kills so many bring the healthcare professionals the criminal justice system the media and the drinks industry into a public debate
595,to the millions caught in the middle of this nightmare something better is owed than the present dishonest shambles
596,our best scientists used to be confined to university research
597,now britain is profiting from their genius
598,some criticisms of britain come and go others seem impossible to shift
599,for nearly a century this country has lived with a sorry fact we have a disproportionate number of the worlds most inventive scientific minds but are truly terrible at exploiting them
600,but all that is becoming a thing of the past
601,the market bubble of 1999-2000 showed that science in all its forms has a huge capacity to excite
602,"small university- originated companies such as osmetech, which makes a hi-tech nose de novo pharmaceuticals which makes based medicine and the nano- technology researcher oxonica are just three that have sprung up and become the target of massive investment"
603,a wave of enthusiasm is washing over the uks academic scientific community as the belief grows that its work may finally see the commercial light of day
604,a lot of the problem has been structural
605,the scientific brains have traditionally been locked away in academic institutions
606,within britains top universities extraordinary advances in medical science engineering and computing have been made but found nowhere to go
607,in recent years the issue has been particularly acute in biotechnology where the pace of progress in gene and protein discovery and its application to medicine has outstripped all expectations
608,but now spurred partly by the stock-market success of a few high-profile companies vice chancellors have realised it is time to extract real value from their laboratory treasures
609,the market bubble may have burst but there are still plenty of venture capitalists ready to dish money out to good ideas and the academic world is playing its part
610,"the products of these collaborations are known as spin-outs, and they are fast becoming the pride and joy of the universities"
611,spin-out companies both small and large are emerging from their alma maters at the rate of more than 10 a month
612,two factors are at work
613,the first is that the government under fire for not making more of british research and fearing another 1960s-style brain drain has set up funding for the commercialisation of research in universities
614,the second is that the universities themselves have been even more energetic in setting up bodies to promote the spin-outs.
615,each has gone about it in a different way but among the top research faculties the results have been similar
616,"as peter hiscocks, director of the cambridge entrepreneurship centre cec says there has been an important change of culture and there is starting to be a real entrepreneurial spirit among academics"
617,a lot of it has been about giving scientists a confidence many of them did not have
618,"as the universities have embraced industry via the spin-outs, they have encountered many of the problems regularly faced by industry such as the ownership of intellectual property ip funding and equity distribution"
619,coping with these has become a crucial task for these newly formed enterprise bodies
620,oxford university has produced some of the highest-profile outs in recent years achieving a particular string of successes in biotechnology
621,"listed companies such as powderject oxford glycosciences and oxford biomedica fall into this category but have been joined more lately by outs such as oxford ancestors which uses dna links to track genealogy and oxford biosignals, which works in neuroscience"
622,oxfords success is largely due to its early adoption of spin-outs.
623,in 1988 the university set up isis a subsidiary devoted to finding ways to commercialise its research
624,as its director tom hockaday says though efforts have increased recently for 14 years isis has been helping scientists to spin out companies
625,most of our time is spent explaining to the university how industry works and to industry about how the university works
626,oxford has traditionally maintained ownership of all the ip created by its research departments and taken stakes in the spin-outs.
627,"very recently it adopted a unique partnership with a company called ip2ipo, a venture half owned by the investment bank beeson gregory"
628,in a deal struck last year oxford received 20m to build a new chemistry lab on the basis that ip2ipo would have the rights to 50 per cent of the value of any ip generated in the chemistry department over the next 15 years
629,the structure has already produced two advanced materials spin-outs: inhibox and pharminox.
630,cambridge meanwhile has adopted a different approach
631,"situated at the heart of silicon fen amid 1,500 hi-tech firms cambridge has long been a powerhouse of commercialised scientific research"
632,but much of it has arrived there without being closely tied to the university
633,its emphasis is on education it does not want to be seen to be pushing academics but is dedicated to making it easier for them if they want to go commercial
634,our mission is to build an entrepreneurial culture at cambridge university by teaching skills to the sort of people that will make ventures successful
635,we have signed up thousands of students to our 18 courses one of the most popular is the basics of building a business says cec director mr hiscocks.
636,for outs that take contracts out with the three- year-old cec the university helps with finding investors and arranging mentoring by some of its older success stories and takes a 3 per cent equity stake
637,now working at the rate of two deals a week cambridge has produced 120 outs over the past 10 years
638,two of the most famous are arm and autonomy which rapidly rose to the ranks of the ftse 100
639,"more recent outs include akubio, a ground-breaking technology that allows accurate virus detection from dirty blood samples"
640,one innovations faculty that is close to breaking even belongs to londons imperial college
641,its body imperial college innovations has produced 50 outs since 1997
642,as its director brian graves explains the ip belongs to the college at first
643,then once the spin- out is complete it is assigned to the new entity and imperial takes a chunk of equity
644,turbo genset the power generation company is among its most famous sons and ones to watch include powerlase and ceres in engineering and gene expression technologies in biotech
645,a similar approach has been taken at southampton university
646,its body the centre for enterprise and innovation cei has produced several highly commercial pieces of research and the flow of outs is rising fast
647,its director tony raven says we try to be pragmatic
648,if there is just one good idea we try to sell it to a company
649,but if the idea looks as though it will lead to a string of other ideas that can be commercialised we encourage the creation of a spin-out
650,photonics is the prime example
651,a very different but highly successful approach has come from umist in manchester
652,unlike other universities umist has set up its own venture style company to carry the scientific research through the whole process of incorporation
653,its chief executive clive rowland is firm some universities use a general ward approach with a consultant coming in every so often
654,we prefer an intensive care approach
655,we are on top of the project all the time and we accordingly have very few casualties
656,we dont like the sink or swim mentality
657,significantly researchers at umist own their ip from the outset
658,prime successes have been phototherapeutics a medical company and vics a pioneer of video imaging on mobile phones
659,the spin-out era is clearly upon us and many believe it could have enough impetus to blow away the traditional shortcomings of british industry's relationship with science
660,"as chris wright chief executive of ip2ipo, says this is the perfect time to be in the business of scientific and hi-tech spin-outs."
661,the government is ready industry is ready the academics are ready and the investors are ready
662,with most big companies admitting that the days of their final salary pension scheme are numbered many employees will find themselves with a smaller retirement income than they may have anticipated
663,ernst & young and iceland both recently closed their final salary schemes not only to new members but to future contributions from existing members
664,the schemes are thought too risky and expensive because of the poor performance of the stock market the rise in life expectancy and labours tax raid on pension funds since 1997
665,to ease the burden the government last week announced that it was relaxing the minimum funding requirement mfr which ensures that pension funds have enough cash to pay people on retirement
666,but much of the damage has already been done
667,in the past 10 years says the tuc the number of people in final salary plans has fallen by 1.8 million leaving just 3.8 million in the schemes
668,so what has happened to those who have lost their final salary benefits
669,"only 200,000 are likely to have transferred to money purchase schemes leaving 1.6 million fewer people with any form of occupational pension"
670,and with the recent acceleration in the closure of final salary schemes the real decline may be even higher
671,over the last decade both employers and the state have been shifting responsibility for pensions provision on to individual employees many of whom have no idea how poor they will be when they retire or simply do not have the spare cash to make the savings needed to build up a sufficient pension pot of their own says john monks tuc general secretary
672,final salary schemes guarantee that you will get a fixed proportion of your salary usually two- thirds in retirement
673,but when employers close them they are usually replaced with defined contribution - or money purchase - schemes which have no such guarantee
674,the final pension is not determined by final salary but by a combination of the performance of the underlying investments and annuity rates at retirement
675,they are much cheaper for employers as their contributions tend to be much lower while the employee takes on all the stock market risk
676,if you find yourself in this position much will depend on the benefits built up in your final salary scheme so far which should be safe
677,there are fears that those nearing retirement will be worst hit as they will have less time to do anything about the changes but if you have been a member of your final salary scheme for a long time the chances are that it will still make up a significant part of your pension
678,those likely to feel the greatest impact are employees in their late thirties or early forties
679,with final salary schemes the value of the employers contribution increases the older you get says adrian boulding pensions strategy director at legal & general
680,so at the age of 20 your employer might pay 5 per cent of salary increasing to 20 per cent by the age of 55
681,if you are turfed out of your final salary scheme into money purchase halfway through your career you will never get the high-value contribution
682,these people are really going to lose out and are most likely to need to top up their pensions
683,everybody's situation is different and it is a good idea to get independent financial advice
684,if you are on higher earnings with complex benefits arrangements you may be able to negotiate with your employer to fund this advice
685,most employers will offer a money purchase scheme in place of the final salary pension
686,if you have a choice do your sums carefully before accepting as it is likely to mean a huge loss for you
687,if you are offered the option of staying with the final salary scheme or moving over to a money purchase scheme as many firms are giving their staff you should stay put advises donna bradshaw director of independent financial adviser fiona price & partners
688,the money purchase scheme may have very high employer contributions but even so you are better off with the final salary scheme
689,if your only option is to join a money purchase scheme it is worth doing so as your employer will contribute
690,work out how much this will be and how much it will cost to replace the benefits you would have received as part of your final salary scheme such as life cover
691,compare this with how much you think you will need to live on in retirement
692,you will have to make up the shortfall which may be possible through additional contributions to your employers money purchase scheme
693,alternatively your company may have an additional voluntary contribution avc scheme that you can put money into
694,or you could opt for a style plan if you earn less than 30000 you can invest in a stakeholder alongside your money purchase scheme
695,what is important is to shop around advises mr boulding and find out which is the most attractive vehicle in terms of the charges and range of investments
696,the sangatte refugee camp has become the focus for the xenophobic tendency on this side of the channel
697,but the existence of the camp does not give rise to the nightly game of hopping at rail yards near the french tunnel entrance
698,as the chief executive of the refugee council said yesterday sangatte is a symptom not the cause of the pressure generated by people wanting to come to britain
699,asylum-seekers and economic migrants are desperate to get to these shores not because of the cornucopia of state benefits which are available they are not nor because we are unusually soft when it comes to enforcing immigration laws we are not but because we speak english and have a strong employment economy
700,the british should regard the modern siege of calais as a compliment and a potential benefit rather than a threat
701,this country can gain a great deal as it has in the past from the determination hard work and enterprise of immigrants
702,many of those refused refugee status should be invited to settle here and make a contribution to our economic and cultural life
703,there are always likely to be however more people who want to come than will be granted permission and so borders will have to be policed
704,as an island nation the practicalities are simpler than they are for other eu countries
705,but the saga of sangatte has shown that in immigration matters no country is an island
706,ideally a common immigration and asylum policy should be agreed at eu level
707,that would make a reality of the idea of european citizenship
708,sadly such an enforceable agreement is unlikely in the near future
709,however if david blunkett develops his plans to allow limited immigration - in addition to our duty of compassion towards those fleeing persecution - it will make it easier to control the riders and lorry- jumpers throughout the european transport network
710,if economic migrants are offered the prospect of legal entry they will be marginally less likely to resort to desperate means of entry
711,rather as basil fawlty couldnt stop talking about the war to his german guests so peter hain the minister for europe finds it almost impossible to stop talking about the euro even though he knows he shouldn't.
712,in a conversation with le figaro that can hardly fail to inflame the treasury mr hain has just floated a detailed timetable for potential british entry into the single currency pointing to a referendum in the spring and autumn of 2003
713,as it happens mr hains remarks were not part of some plot to soften up british opinion for entry
714,today jack straw travels to the hague to make an important speech on the future of european institutions
715,in it the foreign secretary will set out some of the latest british thinking in advance of the convention due to begin at the end of this month under the chairmanship of valery giscard d'estaing.
716,it was hardly in the interests of mr hain as the senior british representative on the convention to do anything to distract from his boss's focus on the daunting exercise in building in which he will be taking part
717,whats more mr hain didnt really confide in le figaro anything that isnt a very open secret in whitehall namely that a working hypothesis exists that would allow a referendum as early as spring 2003
718,and while what mr hain said wasnt really new some of what mr straw says today will be
719,true the intriguing idea of in effect a full-time president of the eu at the very least complementary to the commission president is floated as an option in terms so opaque as to be almost invisible
720,but others such as rotating the presidencies of the ministerial councils which cover subjects ranging from agriculture to the environment every two and a half years and making those council chairs an executive board responsible for the day-to-day running of the eu are substantive
721,and what will shine through is the british belief that it is the ministerial and prime ministerial councils that must be strengthened
722,while there are also ideas for entrenching the european parliaments rights of scrutiny it is the councils composed of representatives of elected national governments which in british eyes principally give the eu democratic legitimacy
723,but if mr hains style tic did not produce anything new it was a reminder if needed of how difficult it is to stay silent about what everyone agrees is by far the biggest decision the government will have to take in the coming year - whether to call a referendum on the euro
724,it does not reflect a change of policy which remains in favour of entry in principle but only if and when mr browns five economic tests are met
725,however what it does reflect perhaps subconsciously is a subtle but perceptible change in the weather
726,it always used to be said subject of course to the tests that mr blair would call a referendum on the euro if and when he thought he could win
727,that no longer has much meaning if it ever did
728,first it implies a greater detachment on the prime ministers part than is justified
729,by all accounts mr blair wants it enough to take what he believes is a justifiable risk
730,he isnt persuaded by the argument - shared by a few in downing street and many more in the treasury - that it would be better to wait until 2006 perhaps by which time the euro would be such a fact of life that the british people would sleepwalk into it
731,he is it is said much more sympathetic to the argument that to wait until then would sap britains credibility in europe would reduce perhaps fatally britains chances of filling the leadership vacuum in the eu and would make it more difficult to reshape policy not least to take one topical example on the rigid stability pact which gordon brown has rightly inveighed against
732,but above all he is said to be increasingly optimistic that he could win in 2003
733,whats more it looks as if mr blair is right
734,its not just that there is gradually increasing polling evidence that once the government - assuming it has the necessary support of mr brown - had recommended entry there could be a majority in favour
735,its also that further detailed preparatory work strongly reinforces it
736,in particular group research for britain in europe suggests that apart from a substantial hardcore minority of opponents the thirst for information on emu - and the publics willingness to take the government seriously as providers of it - is great just as with say aids or the millennium bug
737,i yield to no one in my scepticism of focus groups
738,but this is much in line with what any reporter on the road during the general election could hear with their own ears
739,self-declared opponents of entry if pushed would say first that they didnt know enough about it and secondly that no one is really making the case for it
740,the qualitative research suggests that some of the euro messages - from avoiding isolation to enjoying lower prices - play very powerfully
741,mr hain a veteran of the welsh referendum knows all this
742,one counter-argument is this supposing mr blair became unpopular and the referendum became one on his premiership rather as the french maastricht referendum was on fran�ois mitterand's record
743,well given that mr blairs popularity remains undented after the pounding he has had in the last few weeks its difficult to see how this would happen
744,in that sense ministers may be right when they say that the press may be less in touch than they are
745,that isnt to say a referendum would not be a gamble - albeit a sensible one
746,if the cabinet were to hold - an unprecedented event - a substantive meeting on the issue there would probably be a majority in favour of doing what mr blair wanted because he wanted it
747,margaret beckett appears to be a striking if tentative convert
748,but there are caveats
749,firstly there are strong ministerial voices arguing - for example - that an eu-wide interest rate could leave higher taxes or spending cuts as the only fighting weapon thus jeopardising all labours promises - an argument that could resurface in a referendum
750,secondly entry is not exactly a priority for other cabinet ministers
751,focused on their departments they arent yet geared up for the fight but the big caveat is mr brown
752,whether and how he moves from his present deep caution remains the most fascinating question in british politics
753,by all accounts the big meeting between the two is yet to happen
754,but while mr blair - whose enthusiasm is well attested - is a necessary condition he is not sufficient
755,now it is the chancellor who is both a necessary and sufficient condition for entry
756,there is a link between all this and mr straws speech even though he will not dwell on the euro
757,firstly because a europe on the lines that he will suggest could make entry more congenial to the doubters
758,but secondly because he will offer a robust defence of the eu and of pooling sovereignty to achieve domestic goals
759,but that should not disguise the central fact
760,the key issue is no longer so much one of agonising over whether the british people can wear it but of what is the dynamic within the government
761,there are more important things in life than cate blanchett's breasts but not many
762,all the australian film star had to do was turn up at the premiere of her new movie last week wearing a revealing dress and the column inches filled up as if by magic
763,admittedly blanchett was wearing a nice frock unlike most of the models who took part in london fashion week - skin jewellery and a bearded lady were two of this years highlights - but a photograph of her cupping her breasts was enough to prompt fevered speculation
764,had blanchett dropped a cup size so to speak as a result of pregnancy
765,the films producers must have been delighted as their star effortlessly extended the free publicity they had already received
766,the contemporary fascination with womens bodies is a gift to anyone who has something to sell
767,at the same time it is a strange feature of a culture that could reasonably be described as obsessed with breasts that we seem to know very little about them
768,i have not had children myself but even i know that childbirth produces physiological changes
769,so do the contraceptive pill and getting older which explains why the female population is buying bras in larger cup sizes than it did 20 years ago
770,yet blanchett's appearance in a low-cut dress prompted trawls though picture libraries for before and after photographs as well as confessions from other famous mothers who had experienced this alteration
771,it may be that in an era when womens breasts swell and shrink on the tables of cosmetic surgeons we have forgotten that changes in breast size are a natural phenomenon
772,to be fair almost as much excitement was generated last week by kylie minogue's bottom which was on show in a fetching dress at the brit awards
773,in recent weeks columnists have been wheeled out to explain why we like kylie so much more than britney spears she has even been hailed as a symbol of everything the taliban hated about the modern world
774,this is quite a weight for minogue's diminutive frame to bear and it suggests that the more womens bodies are on display the more they need explaining and decoding
775,of course this is something to do with the fact that most women dont look like blanchett or minogue and tend to be in a state of permanent anxiety about their appearance
776,we no longer know what natural women look like but movie stars and models are no more representative than the ordinary women who are involved in a daily struggle to control their weight
777,in that sense even the most perfect female body has become a plethora of signs pregnant with the prospect of its own disintegration famous women in their twenties are studied minutely for signs of cosmetic surgery anorexia weight gain or an unannounced pregnancy
778,the inspection is clinical enough when the women are young - blanchett is 32 and gave birth to her first child in december - but positively lethal when they get older
779,spotting the signs of ageing has become a spectator sport princess diana was only 36 when she died but royal watchers had already detected dimpled thighs while nicole kidman and jerry hall were both accused of committing the sin of cellulite last year
780,what is so unpleasant about all this is the atmosphere of blame in which it is carried out as though getting older is a lifestyle choice made by lazy women rather than a natural process
781,kylie may have a perfect bottom at 33 but she wont in 15 years time as columnists will delight in telling her
782,when bad people do evil things then those who profit most are other bad people its like they have a sort of arrangement with each other
783,we have already seen the israeli government of ariel sharon taking advantage of last tuesdays attacks in new york by invading palestinian areas and murdering their citizens more or less at random
784,of course with the impeccable instinct for public relations that palestinians have always shown some of the silly bastards allowed themselves to be taped celebrating the events at the world trade centre - theres one fat woman in ugly specs whose witless grinning gob will stay with me for a long time
785,but then 50 years of poverty humiliation and cruelty do not amazingly automatically make you into a good kind or sensible person
786,however i am left wondering given how much circumstances always seem to conspire against the entirely reasonable cause of the palestinian people whether they wouldnt be better off in the end just jacking the whole thing in giving up closing the business shutting up shop with the whole looking-for- justice thing because its not really working out is it
787,yasser arafat might be wise to issue a statement saying something like look lads weve given it a good go but every time we think were getting somewhere then some bloody thing happens which strengthens our enemies and puts us back to square zero
788,i mean i know our only crime in the first place was to be somewhere where a load of people from europe wanted to be but theres too many powerful forces ranged against us so all of your mates at the plo high command have decided were going to knock the whole protest on the head
789,from now on were going to let the israelis push us around steal our land destroy our homes and were going to let them do it without a bleat of protest
790,from now the fateh supreme council can be contacted via a bed and breakfast hotel in dover
791,see you around yasser hanan and all the gang
792,seeing the destruction wrought in the united states watching all the various odious factions scrambling for advantage unable to understand anything except their own twisted point of view made me think what a nasty dangerous species we really are
793,though human beings have the manual dexterity to manufacture all kinds of complex machines our brains dont seem to have evolved at the same pace as our fingers so that what we have in us is a creature with the basic mentality of a coyote but with the ability to create all manner of terrible weapons
794,a while ago the sunday times asked me to take part in selecting photographs taken from 50 years of the magnum photographic agency the theme was to be celebrating the human spirit
795,along with others i was to select six pictures and to write my comments in hand on the back for later publication in the magazine
796,however when i came to look at these black-and-white images what i saw was a species so in love with itself and totally blind to its faults
797,i remember i chose one image of mother theresa and wrote from what ive read about this woman she was a rather nasty piece of work
798,in this photo you can see the self-indulgent vanity shining out of her
799,as they say on the jerry springer show she think she all that but she aint
800,other pictures were meant to illustrate the supposed miracle of yet another child born to clog up the planet
801,funnily enough the sunday times chose not to print my pictures or my comments
802,all they wanted was gooey stuff about the indomitable human spirit the fantastic wonderful specialness of our maggoty little species they didnt want anybody wondering whether the planet wouldnt be a lot better off without us screwing it up
803,i know that james cameron and arnold schwarzenegger are currently working on the third in the terminator series of movies
804,maybe in this latest version the heroes should be skynet the computer that wants to wipe out mankind and cyberdyne systems manufacturers of the killer cyborgs
805,after a titanic struggle john connor the leader of the human resistance is defeated and our kind is wiped from the face of the earth
806,the machines convert themselves into singing cappuccino machines or fly off to explore other worlds or miniaturise themselves until they are the size of an atom and the planet that formerly housed us begins to heal itself
807,the rainforests start to regrow over the shattered landscape cute furry almost- extinct animals emerge to sniff the air and to repopulate the seas again teem with life the skies grow dark with birds
808,and maybe when you think about it george w bush might be arranging that situation for us right now
809,are tourists enticed by these attractions threatening their very existence
810,the two young lions took not the slightest interest in our arrival
811,they were playing on the jetty rolling over and tumbling into the water together entirely ignoring the human beings edging awkwardly round them
812,our party then had to step gingerly over hundreds of marine iguanas basking on the rocks strange creatures with richly coloured velvet coats looking like something between a giant lizard and a miniature dinosaur and found nowhere else on earth except here in the galapagos
813,a little further on were the blue-footed boobies birds with brilliant blue feet again unique
814,and then there were the flightless cormorants birds with vestigial wings who over the generations have lost the ability to fly because the nutrients at the shoreline are so rich they have no need to leave
815,the island of fernandina lies at the far western edge of the galapagos archipelago dominated by a volcano that last erupted only six years ago and home to some of the most remarkable wildlife in the world
816,it was late afternoon on one of the last days of the year and we had come ashore to scramble round the rough dark lava rocks of punta espinosa on the island
817,in the golden afternoon light with the moon rising above the volcanoes on isabela island across the strait we could be forgiven for thinking that we were guests in paradise
818,the creatures you see in the galapagos are remarkable in their rarity
819,they are even more so for their lack of fear
820,they dont run away
821,they carry on basking or playing or mating or incubating their eggs or fighting for territory with blissful disregard for human beings
822,it is as if you are walking into a david attenborough programme and finding that the real thing is even better than you ever imagined
823,the closeness of the living natural world in this environment of volcanic rock and sweeping beaches and sparse vegetation makes the galapagos experience special
824,the colours help too
825,"the intense black of the rock the startling blue of sea and sky the crimson of the mating frigate-birds, the yellow of the warblers the brilliant orange of the american oyster-catchers, the glistening silver of hundreds of dolphins swooping round your ship in the dawn light"
826,we spent eight days in all aboard a boat called tropic sun visiting all parts of the islands
827,we lived ate and slept on the boat and went ashore two or three times a day to walk the trails see the wildlife and snorkel in the sea
828,the boat was hardly the most luxurious experience wed ever had and was certainly not a centre of gastronomic excellence
829,but that really wasnt the point
830,it took us to the places we wanted to see and the expert guide we had who led us round the trails and explained the flora and fauna to us was the best we could possibly have wanted
831,you need not be an inveterate birdwatcher or naturalist to be captivated by what you see
832,you simply cannot help being taken over by a sense of wonder at this different and special world
833,darwins visit in 1835 aboard hms beagle lasted five times longer
834,he marvelled at the tortoises and the iguanas but it was the tiny finches that jolted his imagination most vividly
835,they are still called darwins finches in his honour
836,there are 13 different species of the finches across the islands our group managed to see five or six
837,the fascination is in the beaks
838,each species on each island has over time developed a differently shaped beak adapted to the vegetation and the competition in that particular location
839,these tiny birds with tiny distinctions helped to produce one of the greatest ever advances in the history of scientific thought
840,since darwin called these islands on the equator have struggled to maintain the fragile balance of their ecology
841,over the years the indigenous animal population has been under increasing threat from wayward fishermen or from feral dogs goats and rats escaping from human settlements or boats
842,recently the ecuador authorities started trying to eradicate the invading species and have now succeeded in freeing some entire islands from non-native creatures
843,a giant tortoise breeding programme is in place rearing infants in a protected environment at a time when they are at greatest risk and then returning them to the wild
844,and there are strict laws now in place against harming or destroying the wildlife - though only recently a group of 12 slain tortoises was discovered killed apparently for the japanese aphrodisiac market
845,the most serious ecological threat however is posed by the greatest economic boon the islands have ever had tourism
846,ninety boats ranging in size from 12 passengers to 100 do the rounds of the islands
847,and on the whole the schedules are managed well
848,the itineraries are staggered so that at most two or three boats might appear at one location at the same time
849,when you go ashore you have to be with a guide you cannot stray from the marked trails and you cannot touch the wildlife
850,one of the passengers on our boat was roundly and rightly chastised for stroking a young lion - an action with potentially fatal consequences for the lion because of the risk of rejection by the mother
851,in a country as poor as ecuador the temptation to increase the numbers of tourists is always there
852,we were told theres been a recent request for permission for a much larger boat to travel round the galapagos carrying some 500 passengers
853,i shudder to think what might happen if such a boat arrived at punta espinosa and disgorged everyone on to fernandina island at the same time
854,not only would the shock of a thousand tramping feet endanger the rock the sand and the teeming wildlife that depends on it but it would seriously degrade the quality of the visitors own experience
855,herein lies one of the oldest dilemmas about the evolution of tourism
856,we value and to want to visit the unique and fragile environments of the world
857,yet in visiting we risk destroying the very qualities that render those places so enticing
858,this is especially true where the rarity of the place is quite so marked as it is in the galapagos
859,responsible tourism lies in absolute respect for the location and its inhabitants
860,it lies in treading carefully wherever we go
861,it lies in ensuring that the economic contribution we make by going helps to conserve rather than to destroy
862,and it lies in developing the international networks protecting endangered species and world heritage so that they can make a difference on the ground
863,fortunately in the galapagos charles darwin would recognise much of what he saw if he returned today
864,it is our duty to ensure that he would recognise it again another two centuries hence
865,for the last three weeks there has been an utterly inexplicable rise in the prison population of about 600 prisoners a week
866,the words of martin narey the director-general of the prison service ought to prompt more than the customary political panic
867,"by this morning the prison population which seemed to have stabilised at around 45,000 in the late 1980s and early 1990s will have passed the 70,000 mark"
868,"although the causes of the surge of the past three weeks have baffled those who might know the underlying trend a rise in the number of prisoners of 5,000 since this time last year is utterly explicable and indeed was predicted"
869,prison policy in the uk has been an uphill slalom for the past half-century
870,politicians under pressure to do something about crime pass laws and write guidelines requiring more criminals to be imprisoned for more crimes for longer
871,every now and then however there is a crisis as the walls of our prisons begin to bow under the weight of numbers contained therein
872,politicians then scrabble around for tough alternatives to jail which they try to sell to a sceptical public educated only in a simple up logic that reached its conclusion in the jarring stupidity of michael howards prison works slogan
873,the building programme then catches up with the prison population and we resume the zig-zag which has given us the least successful prison policy in europe
874,the election of a labour government committed to being tough on the causes of crime was a chance to break this self- defeating sequence
875,unfortunately tony blairs first home secretary jack straw lacked the courage to seize it
876,david blunkett is a more adventurous figure and shows some signs of being willing to challenge the assumptions of the past but he still poses too often for the unitive gallery
877,at least he will have no difficulty in rejecting a demand from the prison governors association to take away from magistrates altogether the power to hand down custodial sentences
878,but will he use this crisis to ask deeper questions about why so many people are in prison and whether they should be
879,one of the causes of the rise in the prison population in the past seven years has been the growth of illegal drug use with crack cocaine a particular problem
880,this weeks suggestion that shock tactics should be used to discourage young people from trying heroin is off the point
881,information is important but the interplay between the desire to escape reality and addiction is more complex than a simple pavlovian model
882,medicalising addiction rather than keeping it in the criminal underworld offers the best hope both of controlling drug use and of limiting the effect on crime
883,if people who have problems with illegal drugs alcohol or mental health were taken out of our prisons there would be hardly anyone left
884,when it comes to the wider causes of crime however one of the best places to start is prison itself
885,with 58 per cent of inmates recorded as reoffending within two years of release prison clearly does not work
886,a brave home secretary would conclude that prison obviously reinforces many of the causes of crime
887,it breaks up families and usually gives prisoners nothing better to do than plan how not to get caught next time
888,all parties welcomed the woolf report of 1991 yet none has acted on it to improve the education service in prison
889,if schoolchildren can have life coaches why not prisoners
890,instead education management courses and anything constructive are often the first things to be cut when governors come under pressure to save money
891,our prison system is an affront to a civilised society as is witnessed by the number of legal actions brought by prisoners under the human rights act
892,even if the voters did not care about that they should care that it is a very expensive way of training criminals for more crime
893,many of the alternatives to prison may not result in much better reoffending rates but at least they are cheaper
894,mr blunkett should make the radically pragmatic case for the humane treatment of the nations criminals as a first step in tackling the causes of crime
895,heres something to chew over when pondering the growing problem of obese children
896,the fattest child in my daughters primary school class was also the cleverest
897,her mother came from kuala lumpur and latched onto me as a fellow eurasian when we waited to collect our children after school
898,far from being worried or embarrassed by hannah's humpty dumpty physique - at seven her daughter weighed close to 10 stone - she was obviously proud of what she called hannah's very good size
899,at break while the others played football hannah sat on a bench absorbed in the readers digest or the ladybird guide to the solar system steadily working her way through a family size pack of mini mars bars
900,she came to tea once and explained why although the individual galaxies were constricting the universe itself was expanding
901,she wanted to be an astronaut
902,i had just come back from a press trip to hawaii where one morning all of us apart from a midlands radio presenter called kenny had been taken by helicopter to see some spectacular waterfalls
903,kenny couldnt come because the tour guide said he was too fat and would upset the balance of the helicopter
904,id told the children about kenny and hoped they wouldnt bring it up
905,they didnt because believe it or not they really hadn't noticed hannah was overweight
906,hannah the clever one they'd say not hannah shes fat
907,i wish this story had a happy ending for theres no reason why stories about fat people shouldn't.
908,take kenny
909,from the neck down he looked like mr blobby but he had a surprisingly lean mean profile and a devastatingly sexy voice
910,women in the midlands wrote in every week to tell kenny how much they fancied him
911,when we got back from our waterfall trip we found him on the hotel terrace drinking beer and dealing with his fan mail
912,hannah im sure could have ended up as content as kenny but at 12 she was screwed up by the therapist her mother got hold of to help her lose weight
913,please note it wasnt hannah who wanted to look like kate moss it was her mother forcing her
914,from being a bright happy clever fat girl hannah became a depressed neurotic anorexic teenager who only read books about fashion and diets
915,i bumped into her mother the other day outside the post office
916,hows hannah
917,i said.
918,she was at a health clinic in portugal doing alternate sessions of meditation and colonic irrigation said her mother
919,since the obesity report came out parents have been swamped with advice about how to control their childrens diets and lifestyle
920,the older i get the less im convinced that we poor parents have any control over our children at all
921,this depressing opinion was confirmed by sir richard doll the first doctor to discover the link between cancer and smoking
922,he was on desert island discs and when sue lawley asked plaintively what parents could do to stop their children smoking sir richard said absolutely nothing
923,in fact he opined the more parents nagged at children not to smoke the more likely it was that they would
924,as long as they stopped in their mid-thirties they wouldnt die of lung cancer he thought and there was a very strong chance they would stop smoking as adults having weighed up all the evidence against it
925,im sure the same argument applies to obesity
926,keep nagging at children to stop snacking switch off the television and take exercise the more they will guzzle and slump
927,waiting outside the fitting rooms of a kings road shop the other day i was surprised and dismayed not by how fat kids are these days but how unhealthily skinny they are especially teenage girls
928,the ones trying on crop tops and trousers looked less like nubile young women than scaffolding
929,if you want to see serious obesity go to miami airport
930,its more obvious out there because everyone is wearing shorts
931,the entire airport smells of cinnamon the preferred topping for all those doughnuts theyre selling
932,you see entire families sitting at doughnut stalls with buckets of doughnuts between their knees
933,now thats obesity
934,the money aint the problem
935,its what you do with it
936,the developed world has taken on board the task of rebuilding the shattered economy of afghanistan and has just pledged $1.8bn (�1.3bn) in the first year to this end with a total of $4.5bn over the next few years
937,that is already nearly half way to the un target of 10bn - although the world bank reckons that 15 billion will eventually be needed
938,the task now is to make sure that the money does not disappear down a black hole and that there is a viable economy that can sustain a decent standard of life for its people when the aid cheques run out
939,can it be done
940,afghanistan ranks at or about the bottom of the world scale on most conventional measures of human endeavour insofar as figures are available at all
941,life expectancy is 42.5 years 25 out of every 100 children die before they are five 70 per cent of the population are undernourished and only a third of the adults can read and write
942,it is in that unpleasant expression so often used nowadays a failed state
943,if it can come right that would be a wonderful demonstration to the rest of the world that out of catastrophe can come if not triumph at least a modicum of success
944,the first thing to appreciate is that there are clear limits to what outsiders can achieve
945,consider the money now pledged it is tiny by the standards of developed countries but enormous by the standards of afghanistan
946,"the whole $4.5bn, of which the uks share is $288m, is less than the british taxpayer spent last year in eradicating foot- mouth disease"
947,put another way we spent four times as much on the dome as we are spending on afghanistan
948,but relative to the afghan economy the money is big
949,there are no reliable statistics for its gdp but it is probably about $20bn a year
950,there are some 25 million people but per capita income is only around 800 20 per cent lower than in neighbouring tajikistan and only half that of pakistan
951,so the aid flow will be more than 5 per cent of gdp per annum - and a lot more in the first year
952,that ought to be enough to make a material difference to the countrys wellbeing
953,but it has to be a lasting difference
954,some day the cheques will dry up and the expensive consultants in their white range rovers will go back home
955,in any case these are proud independent people who would not want to live off the meagre handouts of western aid agencies even if these continued to be available
956,it would be nice to think that the various western experts from the world bank and other agencies were going to be more successful at encouraging self-sustaining development here than they have been in for example most of africa
957,but their track record is discouraging
958,are there any reasons to suppose that 10 years from now afghanistan will be seen as even a modest success
959,actually i think there are
960,but it will be largely because of them not us
961,we know enough about economic development to realise that there are several necessary but insufficient conditions for success
962,there has for a start to be physical safety
963,it is not just that wars are immensely destructive of wealth which of course they are but conditions of lawlessness greatly raise the cost of any economic activity
964,there is no point trying to create a business if the proceeds are liable to be stolen local people dont bother and potential outside investors have plenty of other opportunities and stay away
965,it now seems a reasonable assumption that there will be a period of reasonable order or at least conditions where order is possible
966,that creates a climate where contracts can be made and enforced where titles to land and property are respected and therefore where businesses can be allowed to develop
967,next the basic physical infrastructure has to work adequately well
968,if you have power cuts it becomes impossible to run the basic essentials of a modern economy such as computers and faxes
969,roads have to be passable in bad weather the water has to be on the airport has to be functioning flights have to be at affordable prices and of course health care has to be adequate too
970,again there seems a reasonable possibility that most of this physical infrastructure will be fixed to an acceptable level in the next five years
971,there is also a reasonable possibility that living conditions will be sufficiently attractive to encourage skilled people to return to afghanistan to run the infrastructure something that is just as important as basic reconstruction
972,next there has to be a functioning state performing core services and able to collect taxes to pay for these
973,there has to be a functioning banking system enabling and encouraging savings and lending in order to finance economic activity
974,this too looks set to happen
975,so it is possible to be reasonable optimistic about these necessary but insufficient conditions for economic recovery
976,to a fair extent these are problems that money and technical help can solve
977,but ultimately whether the country is successful will turn on other less easily generated - and less easily identified - qualities
978,these have to come from within
979,on the face of it the country seems short of things opium poppies aside to sell to the rest of the world
980,it will gradually have to find these
981,there are some obvious possibilities for example ecotourism and the export of traditional craft products
982,the economy will be supported too by emigrants remittances and has in the diaspora a body of skills and contacts that could be of enormous help in the future
983,but all experience of successful economic development is that it is impossible to plan success
984,instead you have to remove blockages to development spot market signals that suggest that there is an opportunity and then try and reinforce it
985,the greatest reason for hope though is what has been happening in the last few weeks
986,within a few days of the end of hostilities there was a burst of economic activity
987,shops opened trading began
988,despite extraordinarily difficult circumstances the economy got going again
989,this is an enormously encouraging signal for afghanistan
990,who could quibble with the new measures that usher in electronic tagging for persistent child offenders awaiting trial
991,not police chiefs who have been pleading for ages for just such a system
992,at last they have got their wish and pilot schemes will commence in six areas in eight weeks going nationwide in june
993,senior officers complaints have focused particularly but far from exclusively on london - presently in the grip of a crime wave
994,they estimate that up to 30 young offenders acting as if they are immune to the law are operating in each london borough
995,each time they are arrested and put on bail they apparently get straight back out on the streets to commit further crimes or to intimidate witnesses
996,they are adept at playing the system and often do not turn up for their trials so new dates have to be set and witnesses lose interest
997,now instead of simply releasing them prior to their trials the courts will be able to order tagging
998,the suspects will then have to wear ankle bands linked to a unit in their home and connected to a computer
999,the control will be backed by a night-time curfew
1000,the great - and undeniable - advantage is that it is far far better than nothing
1001,which right now is all that courts confronted with an guilty child can offer
1002,one could be forgiven for being under the impression that dealing with this very problem - of persistent young offending - was one of the main pledges that got the blair government delivered to power in the 1997 election
1003,the solution then as i recall was fast-track custodial sentencing
1004,is this new move then simply confirmation that the 1998 crime and disorder act has not worked
1005,it would seem that way to the cynical observer who has been hearing about how persistent young offenders flout the law for years
1006,but in fact the reduction in time between arrest and sentencing targeted by the government was reached and outstripped some while ago
1007,as for the custodial sentences - well the youth prisons are full to bursting conditions in some are terrible and they are worsening
1008,retributive punishment is being exacted in this country at a faster clip than ever often against the same people again and again and again
1009,more prisons are being built at a cracking pace even though the success of the governments moves to tackle young offending so far have proved one thing beyond doubt prison does not work
1010,if this sounds like a contradiction in terms it isnt
1011,if all goes well - and despite appearances it still could - the new prisons will not be supplementing the old victorian ones but replacing them
1012,and god knows those grim disgusting ancient institutions need replacing
1013,they need replacing with more liberal institutions in which the emphasis is not on punishment but rehabilitation
1014,and the institutions that are having the most success with young offenders are the ones doing just that
1015,for decades public feeling has been stirred up against the very idea of soft options
1016,but it is the practical options that work
1017,a young offenders institution in reading for example scored a hit simply by cottoning on to the fact that the south-east was crying out for lift truck drivers
1018,training 50 young offenders resulted in 70 per cent of those on the course finding work on leaving prison
1019,only three have reoffended.
1020,compare that 6 per cent to the 80 per cent of olds who reoffend and the efficacy of retraining becomes obvious
1021,and tagging despite its bad press can work just as well
1022,the trouble is that its not much good on its own
1023,tagging works as part of an issp intensive supervision and surveillance programme
1024,these have been up and running for some time with educational courses drug rehabilitation and schemes in which reparations are made to victims
1025,"issps, though will not apply in the short term to the children affected under david blunkett's new measures"
1026,they will have to wait until they are convicted for the mercies of practical help and expert training to enter their lives
1027,and it is that great irony that sums up the impasse between right-wing and liberal attitudes to young criminals as well as the internal contradictions held within the left-liberal view
1028,the right howls about the unfairness of the most anti-social of young people being the ones who get most help
1029,they continue to bay for blood despite the fact that their tough punitive attitudes have been in the ascendancy for decades now
1030,they do not want offenders to be helped
1031,they want them to be made examples of
1032,but at the same time the left is at fault for a different reason
1033,liberals while insisting that young offenders receive education tailored to their needs are the first people to complain when it is suggested that helping children vulnerable to drifting into crime might be more sensible at an earlier stage
1034,training young offenders to be lift drivers is lauded while offering children or entire schools courses in which vocational or practical skills are taught alongside academic ones is viewed with distrust
1035,what a weird unhelpful contradiction this is
1036,yes it is unfair that disturbed children get the attention they crave only after they have become criminals
1037,but the right-wing answer - denying them this - is wrong
1038,likewise the conservative call for difficult schoolchildren to be put into sin bins is wrong
1039,what isnt wrong though is realising that many very young people in this country need the kind of guidance that issps can offer before they even break the law - or are caught doing it
1040,im not suggesting here that difficult children should be treated like young criminals
1041,instead im suggesting that young criminals should be treated like difficult children
1042,the strategies for dealing with young people who are not coping with the education system as it stands should be similar whether or not they have committed crimes
1043,it is mad for an institution on the inside to be considered loonily liberal because it offers manual job training and drug rehab and one on the outside to be labelled a sin bin because it can offer lost youngsters similar help
1044,the annoying thing is that the government appears to know this
1045,its policies point rather lamely in a direction whereby this happy state of affairs might be achieved
1046,but again and again this government ducks the real business of politics
1047,instead of winning hearts and minds it prefers to take the cowards way out and spin its liberal policies so that they appease rather than inspire those on both sides of the political divide
1048,the result is not quite but something akin to entropy
1049,instead unbelievably the police the judiciary and the prison system are blamed for rising crime
1050,isnt it pretty obvious that without crime we would not need these institutions at all
1051,they need to be viewed as part of the solution not part of the problem
1052,to this end they all need reform - the judiciary being the only one that has ducked it and the one that needs it most
1053,but these are merely the bodies that deal with the human detritus we call criminals
1054,it is our wider world that makes them
1055,diaries exposing the secret life of kurt cobain the nirvana singer who killed himself eight years ago have been sold to a publishing house for 28m
1056,cobain's estate which is managed by his widow courtney love struck the deal with riverhead books a us subsidiary of the british media giant pearson after fierce bidding
1057,the journals which are said to include frank accounts of cobain's battles with depression and heroin addiction are likely to be published this year
1058,cobain who was 27 when he killed himself in 1994 began writing his diaries when he was a teenager and continued during his to fame
1059,james barber who assists ms love in managing the estate told an american newspaper yesterday that the diaries contained really cool stuff
1060,there are revelations about encounters with groupies and a handwritten draft of smells like teen spirit which took the seattle grunge band to the top of the charts
1061,there are also lists of cobain's favourite records rules he set for the band and letters from fans
1062,although the publication is bound to provoke renewed speculation about the life and death of the controversial star mr barber insisted the estate was conscious of protecting his reputation
1063,hes not here and our responsibility is to promote his creativity and his legacy he said.
1064,julie grau editorial director of riverhead part of penguin putnam said the journals are an intimate portrait of an artist of great influence
1065,they were a vital source for charles cross's biography of the singer heavier than heaven after he was granted access to them by courtney love
1066,she has provoked much criticism before and since cobain's death in 1994 standing accused of manipulating him in life and then exerting unreasonable control of his legacy
1067,she was the best-selling queen of the romantic aga saga
1068,he was the enfant terrible of the on urban literati
1069,would the earth move when their paths crossed
1070,i quite like joanna trollope shes warm engaged and responsive and clearly has her heart in approximately the right place
1071,to me she is a quintessentially english phenomenon the middlebrow novelist who has just enough sophistication to be able to convince her readership that they may be getting an middlebrow product
1072,"shes also quite vulnerable joanna and has had quite a monstering from the daily mail that paper bastion of agashire, which is of course her proper province"
1073,in an interview in another newspaper last week joanna seemingly admitted to leading a rather unseemly life nowadays cruising the london streets on the lookout for thirtysomething men to have uncommitted sex with
1074,she also posed for a photographer exhibiting her long slim legs clad in fishnet stockings
1075,predictably the envious wrath of middle-aged middle england descended on her this scion of the sleeveless anorak and the liberty headscarf
1076,i was miserable and i then had stringers from the daily mail all over my patch in the country my mother everyone you can think of trying to get people to rubbish me.
1077,and you do then feel like a cornered animal
1078,im just so conscious a lot of the time that its horrible for my children having a well-known mother its beastly having a parent in the public eye
1079,i observe to joanna that its really quite vulgar being famous and she concedes that it is
1080,she says that she continues to publicise her books quite as much as she does because shes always waiting to go out of fashion because with every book i think this will be it and i suppose ive had a sort of superstition about prolonging that moment but that after last week im asking myself very seriously why
1081,she says that the remarks about sex she made were general rather than specific to her and were quite misrepresented
1082,anyway she said those things only after courteously answering a long string of sexual enquiries
1083,i believe her in all this
1084,joanna doesnt want to make a fuss although when i ask if shed like me to outline the dispute as i have above she says that would be excellent will
1085,joanna uses my first name quite a lot when we talk and i think this is partly sincere and partly political
1086,shes quite attractive and looks - as many have observed - young for her 58 years
1087,however not absurdly dorian gray-ishly so shes no marie helvin.
1088,i think the brouhaha that surrounds poor youthful joanna has as much to do with her rotten old borough of a constituency as it does with anything intrinsic to her
1089,sitting on the other side of a boring coffee table in the dull matutinal hinterland of the soho members club in which we meet for an hour on a rainy weekday she looks sleek in flared leather trousers a length woollen jacket with a leather collar and silver jewellery boadicea boss earrings thin stranded bracelet
1090,she looks in fact like what she is a million- selling lady novelist of a certain age
1091,the trouble is that on the evidence of her conversation that age is about 33 rather than 58 and quite a young 33 at that
1092,theres this business of the wills to begin with - when i tell her that both my parents are dead hers are alive her emotion swells and prolapses all over the table oh will i am so sorry although she then qualifies this by conceding that its my children and my parents that shes sorry for
1093,the daily mail feels that joanna has reinvented herself as a leggy sex siren in order to flog more books particularly as her latest girl from the south features 30-year-old protagonists and is set in the distinctly racy environs of parsons green
1094,but joanna says if i was once seen as a provincial housewife in a laura ashley cardie under an apple tree with labradors - which was also a misrepresentation - the life im living now does not lack its own integrity it is not a false fa�ade.
1095,theres a sort of abiding irritation about being assumed somehow not to be true to yourself
1096,well indeed and i dont think for a minute joanna has self-consciously and manipulatively created a new public image to sell books
1097,no i think shes distinctly immature and despite 10 years of media exposure she doesnt quite understand that press interviews are not the place to discuss your jejune self-image problems
1098,joanna's had quite a bad time
1099,her second marriage of 18 years ended in divorce three years ago and she had quite a severe breakdown that left her virtually incommunicado for a further year
1100,now shes living in west london she wont be more specific as she savours her newfound metropolitan anonymity attending cultural events galore dating and - of course - writing more stories
1101,i think joanna's quite modest but not as modest as she would like to be
1102,to me she says of her books i think theyre good with distinct weaknesses and sometimes i think i have a flash of insight
1103,but theres a huge difference between being good and being great
1104,its very difficult to know isnt it looking at our contemporaries who will emerge as great
1105,"y'know, i think the odd john fowles will"
1106,penelope fitzgerald i think will but im under absolutely no illusion about where i fit in.
1107,im right for these times ive got a kind of acuteness about contemporary relationships thats right for now but its not going to be right for ever
1108,discounting the oddity of finding myself bracketed with her as a contemporary of j fowles (b1926) and p fitzgerald (b1916) - which rather stretches the notion of contemporaneity beyond the bounds of my sense - i find this 'umble dismissal of her craft by joanna as being mere acuity quite difficult to take as the only other writer she ascribes it to is the one she insists on calling the real trollope
1109,no joanna has that affectation of the successful of appearing to be dismissive of her own standing while clearly believing that the important voting is done by the feet of a thousand thousand readers
1110,i read every review and the bad ones if written by someone i admire i take really to heart i mean i think we can all profit from them
1111,but the people i have the greatest faith in are the readers
1112,they are amazing theyre the ones that have contributed to professional confidence
1113,well indeed and why shouldn't she feel that way
1114,joanna has quite a passion for the queer intimacy afforded her by her craft
1115,to me she says i met a woman in france last year who said to me 'you've been sitting in my kitchen for the last three years
1116,she admits quite shamelessly that she conducts numerous interviews as part of the research for her novels but when i put it to her that this suggests she doesnt have much faith in her imagination she vehemently asserts im not looking for information im looking for what i expect to be the case to be confirmed
1117,shes been quite nettled by reviewers who've said that her thirtysomethings in the latest book wouldnt use the archaisms she ascribes to them - i wanted to hear it in their language the urgency of their feelings i think the truth is that her interviewees - whom joanna obtains by word of mouth - come from exactly her milieu and that explains why they all sound rather like characters in a joanna trollope novel
1118,this quite blinkered perception of the world is common to the novelist and the books
1119,joanna is the sort of woman who says im just like every woman of my generation we can all speak adequate french we all went to ballet class and we can all ride
1120,the missing adjectives in her sentence being quite clearly upper-middle-class english
1121,in a whole class we would call this attitude bigotry in a single woman of joanna's age and breadth of experience one can only call it naivety
1122,her observations on the current generation of thirtysomethings as against her own generation at that age are inconsistent and near-contradictory.
1123,she says to me at one point theyre not politicised like my generation were at university
1124,theres no clear-cut ambition for the world the way i remember it at university in the sixties
1125,yet a few minutes later she announces theres a freedom for radicalism now that there really wasnt when i was growing up
1126,i mean that was one of the things that charmed me about the age group in this book - how free they are of so many of the assumptions and prejudices that we all grew up with in the sixties
1127,still i wouldnt wish tedious consistency on joanna any more than i want her dragged back to the shires kicking and screaming
1128,she concedes that her success and consequent wealth have divorced her somewhat from her readers but shes determined not to lose touch with the little daily lacerations of the spirit that she writes so acutely about
1129,i suspect the truth is that while joanna remains so in thrall to the way she and her work are received by the world there are plenty more little lacerations in store for her
1130,and thats quite a shame
1131,space shuttle columbia and a crew of seven blasted into orbit this morning on a mission to renovate the hubble space telescope
1132,after a one-day wait for warmer weather columbia went into clouds just before dawn as hubble was passing nearly overhead
1133,the launch was surrounded by extraordinarily tight security to guard against possible terrorist attack
1134,f-15 fighter jets were on patrol and a no-fly zone was in force within 35 miles of the launch pad
1135,nasa's oldest shuttle fresh from an overhaul had a perfect start to its 11-day flight
1136,its been two years and seven months since columbia last flew said shuttle manager james halsell
1137,it got onto orbit without even as much as a minor fault message much less any type of major alarm
1138,columbia is loaded with 172 million of scientific power and steering parts for hubble
1139,the astronauts will conduct five spacewalks next week to install all the equipment on the 12-year-old telescope
1140,the parts include stronger solar wings more robust control unit more reliable steering mechanism refrigeration system to resuscitate a disabled infrared camera and advanced camera to increase hubble's capability for discovery by 10 times
1141,nasa considers this the most complicated hubble servicing mission yet because of the heavy workload and a pair of unprecedented spacewalking jobs
1142,neither the control unit nor infrared camera repairs were meant to be tackled in orbit
1143,before the old control unit can be removed and the new one installed all of hubble's systems must be turned off for the first time ever in orbit
1144,scientist say there is a greater chance that the current power unit will eventually fail than there is that the telescope or even a major portion of it will not come back on following the repairs
1145,this is nasa's fourth visit to hubble
1146,the first service call in 1993 corrected the telescopes blurred vision
1147,one more servicing mission is planned after this one in 2004
1148,then if nasa has its way the telescope will be returned to earth in 2010 for museum display
1149,nobody expects the spanish inquisition
1150,was a well-known and much remembered phrase from a sketch in the monty python series of the early 1970s
1151,but now at last the spanish can get their own back by chortling todos saber de uno soldado marino ingles
1152,whenever the odd royal marine crops up on one of their beaches by mistake
1153,the spanish policeman who reacted with charming aplomb at the invasion that never was will probably be kicking himself that he didnt come up with good morning commander bond weve been expecting you
1154,nevertheless the spanish emerge with great credit for not reacting to the tread of foreign boots on their sand
1155,in elizabethan times a dead monkey washed up on a beach would spread alarm and anxiety about imminent invasion and protestant plots
1156,but now the spanish have the experience derived from decades of watching tattooed brits in replica football shirts trashing their coastal towns and this has probably reduced the spanish authorities to a weary acceptance of the extremes of our behaviour
1157,indeed they might well have believed that the incoming commandos were an advance party of hooligans doing a recce for a forthcoming champions league game
1158,rather than counter-attack or run away somebody in the spanish chain of command must have realised pretty quickly that here was a golden chance to neutralise certain long-running iberian stereotypes and set up some new anglo-saxon ones instead
1159,forget the magnificence of sir francis drake raiding cadiz he is so over
1160,now your english public-school officer class cannot even find gibraltar on a sunny day
1161,ha
1162,indeed it is the negotiations over the future of gibraltar's sovereignty that will have been most affected to spanish advantage by this incident
1163,you can imagine the quiet smirks on the faces of spanish diplomats when they next meet their british counterparts
1164,the amusing thought may cross the spanish consciousness that they are no longer dealing with a democratically elected government that is a partner to spain in the european community but an out-of-control junta ready to turn to military force at the slightest excuse
1165,didnt the british government run something rather sinister up the flagpole last week about licensing mercenaries to enact foreign policy
1166,could this have been the first dry run for these rogue elements giving a warning to spain about what might kick off if they do get their hands on gibraltar
1167,the timing is suspicious to say the least
1168,in all cold wars the enemy likes to test the nerves of its opponents
1169,some of you may remember all those soviet factory ships that used to cruise the north sea eavesdropping on our radio transmissions and looking for weaknesses in the eastern seaboard defences
1170,so perhaps the spanish shouldn't feel so smug after all
1171,maybe it is all a combined save gibraltar faction/dogs of war plot to destabilise se�or aznar's confidence in el tony blair
1172,such conspiracy theories will be laid aside in due course once we realise that the spanish invasion of britain has been completed in mostly harmonious circumstances
1173,there are the hundreds of bright and noble spanish nurses who are helping out our beleaguered national health service in and around blackpool
1174,we should not forget either how much employment the spanish magazine hola
1175,has brought to this country for the hard- working photographers and front-line journalists of hello its english counterpart
1176,the spanish have also taken over a large share of our south-western fishing fleet and nobody will need reminding that a certain enrique iglesias has topped the british pop charts for the past three weeks
1177,bravo
1178,as the first phase of the official inquiry into the death of victoria climbie drew to a close yesterday this is perhaps a good moment to recall the words of lord laming the chairman of the inquiry on the opening of the proceedings some months ago
1179,at that time he said that he hoped that the climbie case would mark a turning point and that the lessons of the case would result in proper protection for vulnerable and abused children in britain
1180,lord laming is certainly right to hope for such an outcome but the long list of previous high- profile abuse cases suggests otherwise
1181,victoria climbie's name joins those of kimberley carlile jasmine beckford maria colwell shirley woodcock and many others all of which had a similar shocking impact on the public and the authorities but sadly seemed to have no lasting effect
1182,it is obviously unrealistic to expect that we will never again see a case like that of victoria climbie; but it is not too much to ask that the same mistakes be not made time and again by the authorities and voluntary agencies that work in the field
1183,in particular the government needs to take urgent action to deal with the standards of some local authorities social services departments
1184,it bears repeating that the abuse of victoria climbie - amounting to the torture and indeed the murder of the eight-year-old - took place not in some prison or care home but in the community
1185,her injuries were inflicted over a period of many months and were seen by hospital staff and by social workers
1186,carole baptiste the haringey social worker whose job it was to oversee the climbie case was apparently developing a serious psychotic mental illness at the time
1187,documents have been lost
1188,however time and again and far too often we find with a sense of depressing inevitability that social workers have in some way been found wanting in the discharge of their vital duties
1189,often it is also the case that the resources are not there to employ sufficient social workers or to attract the best into the field
1190,sometimes monies intended for the care of the most vulnerable are diverted by councils
1191,although it is right that ministers should spend so much of their time and effort on setting targets and rating performance in our schools and hospitals there has long been the feeling that social services have been very much a cinderella public service
1192,nor should we be afraid to ask tough questions about race did the idea that black cultural norms must always be respected contribute to victorias neglect
1193,if the climbie case and all those that preceded it is about anything it is about the need for a thorough overhaul of the funding and staffing of social services departments in every local authority in the country
1194,this has to be undertaken by central government because as the cynical and obstructive attitude of haringey council demonstrates it seems beyond many town halls to accept responsibility for their failings
1195,at the same time the role of the nspcc in this case also leaves something to be desired and should act as a stark warning to all those who feel that a greater role for the voluntary sector welcome as it may often be is some sort of guarantee of higher standards of care
1196,victoria climbie was referred to a nspcc family centre in august 1999
1197,the inquiry heard that no effort was made to see the child because staff were preoccupied with organising a party
1198,so let us hope that the climbie case will mark a turning point for the lamentable standards that seem to prevail in social services
1199,this will need pressure from whitehall and so far there is little sign of it being applied
1200,have i ever mentioned that i come from woodman stock
1201,not woodman in the sense of wild man from the primeval undergrowth or hunter of game in the queens forests but woodman as in sensualist of the plank
1202,my father was one of those men who went nowhere without a saw in his hand a sheet of sandpaper in his pocket and nails in his mouth
1203,"a jew is by rhyming slang a four-by-two, but those measurements cut no ice in our house"
1204,"two-by-one, that was my fathers first love and for the perfect length of one - dead straight when you pointed it at the south pole and cast your eye along its length so smooth you could sleep entwined around it - he would have swapped his offspring"
1205,fortunately he never found what he was looking for
1206,perhaps he knew he never dared
1207,the search for it informed his life though making him sad and introspective in the end a haunter of timber merchants and junk yards someone who went into bookshops only to examine the shelves and who fell into a brown study when we visited relatives who through poverty or design lived in uncarpeted rooms
1208,while the rest of us took tea and talked he would sit with his head between his knees sizing up the floorboards and cutting them into the ideal dimensions in his imagination
1209,a good job we weren't still living in the forests of podolia in log cabins
1210,unless that was exactly what he was missing
1211,though no chip off the old block myself - all i ever made after five years of learning woodwork at school was a splint to hold the finger id broken while trying to plane a lid for someone elses pencil box - i am still fondly reminded of these my timbery beginnings by the newspaper photographs of those thousands of tons of swedish pine washed up on the cornish coast last week all the firewood in hell enough matchwood to keep the devils furnaces aflame for ever
1212,if ever you wondered what conceptual artists were striving for here once and for all it is constructed with sufficient absence of construction to make every one of them from the most plainly functional to the most superfluously grandiose - from carl andr the bricklayer to old clingwrap christo himself - eat their own hearts
1213,"behold every art clich of the last 100 years the objet trouv� with a vengeance the ordinary become amazing scale changing meaning the natural become unnatural space and volume redefined litter striving to be beauteous beauty striving to be litter the gallery rendered otiose, randomness made magisterial materials mocking their origin for here is a towering forest of that which came from forests and best of all the artist nowhere to be seen"
1214,god the great conceptualist
1215,charles saatchi must be looking to sign him up even as we speak and serota wondering how to squeeze him on to the shortlist for this years turner
1216,can god giggle like a ninny when they offer him the cheque
1217,god is all powerful
1218,he can do anything
1219,did he not make andy warhol employing none of the elements we normally associate with life
1220,i would like to think that the cornish have been out in their thousands thronging the shoreline to marvel at this glorious sight - art rescued from the wreck of commerce destruction itself destroyed
1221,but by all accounts they have just been driving to the sea and filling the boots of their cars with offcuts.
1222,perhaps they marvelled first and scavenged later
1223,wrecking they call this down there
1224,i lived among the cornish once and recall more than one occasion when the word went around that there were valuables being washed in on the tide
1225,out came the torches and the wellington boots and off wed all troop prepared to climb down ropes thousands of feet into the raging blackness disturbing the homes of screaming sea birds swaying in the gale howling falling breaking limbs half drowning sometimes in order to lay our hands on some punctured sack of sodden tea or box of christmas decorations fabricated in taiwan and now smashed into a thousand pieces
1226,then up the cliffs wed haul ourselves again clasping our treasures to our chests - a shining example of the truism that it is not the winning that matters but the taking part
1227,and all the following day the village would be alive with tales of our adventures
1228,such things wed found down there
1229,gold and silver
1230,watches cut from dead mens wrists
1231,rings pulled from the whitened fingers of society women still fragrant but destined to cruise the oceans of the world no more
1232,a tiara no less seen floating in a rockpool at first mistaken for a jellyfish
1233,wrecking is a form of social vengefulness you see
1234,a way of seeing to it that what goes around comes around
1235,imperial caesar dead and turned to clay stopping a hole to keep the wind away
1236,a rafter meant for a palace now a kitchen shelf in portwrinkle.
1237,though he was no climber i can picture my father down there on the beach in seventh heaven a retractable measure in his hand a pencil in his ear perhaps sawing a plank over one knee something he tried to teach me to do once until my mother hearing the saw cutting through cartilage came running out and stopped him
1238,he didnt mean me to have no legs
1239,he just wanted me to love wood as he did
1240,what a disappointment i was to him
1241,but it could have been worse
1242,he could have had andy warhol for a son
1243,so the politicians especially tessa jowell the secretary of state for culture media and sport are worried that the bbc is considering dumbing down its coverage of politics
1244,but few - apart from political junkies such as me - would necessarily blame greg dyke the director general for looking at new ways of making politics less boring to viewers
1245,the fact is that apathy reflected at the low turnout in elections is also mirrored in the turn-off that politics has become for many viewers and listeners
1246,before the politicians get too high and mighty they should momentarily spare a thought for mr dyke as he wonders why so few normal people - especially the young - actually watch his excellent programmes on politics
1247,dont get me wrong i am not against the desire to maintain the interest of the viewer in politics and i think that any attempt to reduce the output of political coverage would be a mistake
1248,in fact more than that i also have a financial interest to declare
1249,i am privileged to take part in many political programmes broadcast by the corporation and i would suffer financially as a consequence
1250,i find it ironic however that i have the opportunity of participating far more these days on radio and television than i ever did as an mp
1251,maybe that should tell us something
1252,it could be that tied to a whip a pager and a political script i had nothing useful to say
1253,now that i have to use my brain instead of my pager perhaps i might appear more interesting
1254,at present the bbc provides extensive coverage of politics and the proceedings of the house of commons
1255,i do not think there has ever been a time when there has been so much coverage
1256,just consider an average sunday
1257,on television it starts with breakfast with frost and this is followed at lunchtime by on the record
1258,meanwhile radio 4 provides broadcasting house in the morning and the westminster hour in the evening
1259,meanwhile radio 5 live offers us sunday service
1260,that adds up to five hours of in-depth and extensive political coverage - excluding radio 4s lunchtime news show the world this weekend
1261,for a day on which many are seeking a rest from political debate i reckon if anything the bbc is actually going well beyond its call of public duty
1262,during the week in addition to the regular news and current affairs programmes such as newsnight and today there are other round-ups of events in parliament
1263,dispatch box on bbc 2 was added to the political stable of the corporation four years ago and provides a 30-minute nightly magazine round-up and also includes robust live studio discussion
1264,"admittedly this programme is for insomniacs because it goes out after midnight - but then since parliament does not adjourn until 10.30pm, it is hardly possible to put out such a programme much earlier"
1265,and then there are the two hour-long westminster live programmes put out on tuesdays and wednesdays which cover question time in the commons and much more
1266,add radio 4s yesterday in parliament and today in parliament plus saturdays week in westminster and this all points to a pretty impressive coverage for what is in large measure just a minority pursuit
1267,if anything it can be argued with some justification that the bbcs output has actually increased in recent years
1268,so no politician can claim that there has been any down yet
1269,however greg dyke has a right to ask whether his viewers are actually watching or listening to any of these programmes
1270,there are some i am one that say that he has a duty to provide programmes on political affairs regardless of how many are tuning in.
1271,but he in turn is entitled to ask why so few payers are thanking him for such coverage
1272,could it be because it is the politicians themselves rather than the broadcasters who are dumbing down
1273,parliament has only itself to blame if its proceedings are such a turn-off
1274,and if some of the programmes go out at an inconvenient time could this not be because of the inconvenient hours that the commons currently sits
1275,the trouble is that politicians rarely watch or listen to television or radio and maybe are simply unaware of just how unappetising they appear to the rest of us
1276,one can hardly blame the bbc for wanting to get away from simply covering the proceedings of a largely empty commons chamber where there are often only a dozen or so mps present
1277,the only significant thing that registers in the minds of some viewers is the backcloth of empty green benches
1278,perhaps if mps attended the debates in larger numbers there might be more of an incentive to want to watch
1279,ironically it has been the provision of the live tv feed to mps in their swanky offices that has been one of the reasons for the decline in attendance
1280,then there are the making labour stooges who ask their idiotic scripted questions along the lines of is the prime minister aware that he is marvellous
1281,this week the speaker ruled that the leader of the opposition could not ask the prime minister questions about the labour party and its funding by trade unions - implying that mr blair as prime minister was not responsible for the labour party
1282,this is bizarre
1283,presumably this strict interpretation means that parliament cannot now even question ministers on the leaked labour party health policy document that suggests that the nhs might in future be less than free at point of use
1284,the attempts to stifle open debate in the commons mean that for the rest of us the impression is reinforced that parliament is a place where questions in debates simply go unanswered
1285,and when anyway so many of the broadcasters are then confronted with the refusal of ministers to appear on programmes who can blame mr dyke for wondering if the manner of political coverage should not be reviewed
1286,how many times do we hear interviewers saying we invited a minister to appear but none were available
1287,in such circumstances it is the politicians evasions that are responsible for the down of their trade
1288,it would be sad if politics were to lose the attention of the bbc but it is up to the politicians not mr dyke to make their case
1289,lesley monk a 51-year-old from burnley explains to mark mackenzie why she and her team of huskies are going flat out to conquer the wastes of alaska
1290,while you are reading this lesley monk is taking her dogs for a walk
1291,sixteen of them in fact and not just for a quick once-round-the-park.
1292,"all being well the 51-year-old personal trainer from lancashire is now one day into an 1,100- mile trek across the frozen alaskan wilderness the only british competitor in this years iditarod the most demanding sled race on earth"
1293,while the winner of an event billed as the last great race in the last great place will be sipping victory champagne in front of a roaring fire inside of 10 days lesley and the other 67 mushers can expect several weeks on the trail which will push them to the limits of their endurance
1294,polar bears fragile ice and temperatures regularly below 60c are just some of the optional extras on a tour itinerary that requires sleep on the move as well as hours spent massaging weary canine shoulders and feet
1295,the race takes its name from the village of iditarod one of 26 checkpoints along the way as competitors race from anchorage in the east of the state to nome in the west a rerun of an historic journey
1296,in 1925 a nome doctor wired anchorage pleading for medicine for an outbreak of diptheria
1297,with no other transport available teams of mushers transported the serum in a dramatic relay across the frozen tundra
1298,the patient was saved and conveniently for the logo writers the legend was born
1299,nan of which explains how for the third time in 14 years a former hairdresser with a dysfunctional lung finds herself racing some of the hardiest backwoodsmen in north america across their own back yard
1300,lesley's first encounter with a husky alaska's working dog was with one owned by a friend she was visiting in new york in the mid-eighties
1301,in england we were living on a farm in a highly touristy area she explains on holiday we were greeted by this gentle dog that looked incredibly fierce
1302,deciding huskies were an excellent way to dissuade tourists from wandering up their drive lesley and her husband roy tracked down a breeder in britain
1303,the breeder explained the husky was a working dog and only let me take one away on condition that i worked it
1304,three times a week i would drive to the outskirts of leeds and run the dog with a team behind a cart
1305,the monks obsession with the highly intelligent breed saw their canine family swell to 20 and eventually led them to alaska and via smaller qualifying races to lesley's first iditarod in 1988
1306,i was a total rookie and was pretty overwhelmed by the whole thing she says
1307,i had one absolute dread that id finish last and be out there in the wilderness all on my own
1308,which is precisely what happened
1309,nineteen days after leaving anchorage having struggled to cope with the pace and physical demands of the race lesley crossed the finish line to claim the red lantern the wooden spoon
1310,i was devastated to finish so far back and i loathe talking about getting the red lantern
1311,but with hindsight it was the best thing that could have happened because now on the trail there are very few things that phase me
1312,her disappointment over her 1988 placing emphasises the fiercely competitive nature of the event
1313,lesley's next outing was in 1990 when she was forced to scratch after her sled and team went through thin ice attempting a river crossing
1314,the water was only thigh deep but my sled sank and the dogs were in the water getting tangled up in their gang lines
1315,the problem was compounded by the following teams who were jumping over us to get across and were getting tangled themselves
1316,while lesley insists there is camaraderie between the mushers competitors will only come to anothers aid if a situation is life-threatening
1317,given that leading racers have also been known to confuse the chasing pack by removing trail markers as they pass this clearly isnt the london marathon
1318,but then 50000 35000 in prize money is a hefty sum in outback alaska
1319,and bearing in mind that only four of this years field are of alaskan descent 50000 it seems is a lot money everywhere else
1320,the iditarod was first raced competitively in 1974 when it was won by dick wilmarth in 20 days
1321,around a dozen dogs died through exhaustion the result of poor nutrition
1322,races since have had huge teams of vets and the death rate has fallen to below four dogs per thousand
1323,while the humane society of the us have been trying to get the race banned for many years race vets rightly contend that the death rate is about equal to that in a sedentary canine population
1324,and animal welfare has certainly progressed from centuries past when native alaskans tethered husky bitches in woodland to mate with local wolves
1325,if the wolf chose to mate with rather than eat his blind date the outcome would be a litter of working dogs with a wild toughness
1326,all the attention is focused on the dogs and nobody really cares about you lesley explains
1327,the rules state that the sled must have the capacity to carry an injured dog under cover as well as demanding one compulsory 24-hour rest and two eight-hour breaks at checkpoints
1328,these are on top of the camp breaks we take out on the trail
1329,people who dont know these animals have no idea what they are capable of
1330,their speed and stamina are breathtaking and if you get the right balance of personalities in your team you can really fly
1331,while the demands on the dogs are immense the demands on the mushers are equally daunting
1332,if the team is down for eight hours the dogs are resting but youre constantly working rubbing ointment into cuts on feet massaging joints preparing food says lesley
1333,when you set off youre exhausted and the dogs want to run like the wind
1334,and the treats in store back on the trail are many
1335,mushers need tremendous aerobic fitness to be able to scoot skateboard style with one leg on the sled for long distances
1336,should conditions become sticky scooting turns to old-fashioned running to maintain the most prized weapon in the mushers armoury momentum
1337,standing still for extended periods also places tremendous strain on the arms and back and should you take your eye off the trail at the wrong moment you could wind up with a smack in the chops from an overhanging branch
1338,and unless your screams carry across miles of wilderness youre in trouble
1339,yet despite the hazards lesley is undaunted
1340,i keep going back because i love it she says
1341,shopping sure but culture
1342,can this gulf state offer anything other than golf courses and gold souks
1343,wake up to a different view
1344,it is early in the morning
1345,i look out of the window and see below me the clear calm turquoise waters of the gulf
1346,above me the sky is already pale blue
1347,between the turquoise and the pale blue a haze of mother of pearl wreaths the city that stretches out from the shore in the pale silky colours of an expensive negligee
1348,the spires and towers of dubai's astonishing architecture stretch up out of the mist like some fantastic palace from the arabian nights
1349,even what i later discover is an industrial installation looks like a fairytale fortress in this light
1350,its difficult to believe that it wont melt away like a mirage or a vision
1351,vision
1352,its a key word here
1353,modern dubai exists you will be told thanks to the vision of sheikh rashid bin saeed al maktoum the father of the present ruler sheikh maktoum
1354,his farsightedness created a gulf state that is no longer dependent on the profits from oil but is a world centre of business and trade
1355,dubai's visions come on a grand scale and they take physical shape with remarkable speed
1356,"you want two man-made islands shaped like palm trees each with 40 miles of coastline housing 40 hotels 2,000 luxury villas etc etc etc"
1357,construction begins next year
1358,you want to turn a shopping mall into an entire city complete with parks childrens playgrounds hotels and apartments
1359,consider it done
1360,my vantage point for this dawn view of the city is a 361 metre 1184 feet high hotel shaped like a boat and looking like a spinnaker
1361,it rises from the sea on a man-made island while a second hotel shaped like a cresting silver breaker lies like a bow wave beneath it
1362,this is the star burj al arab
1363,completed only three years ago it is already an icon
1364,it deserves iconic status i think
1365,its a beautiful building almost organic in feel once you are inside with its layers of floors rising up tier upon tier like the interior of a beehive or a strange seed pod
1366,at the top is what looks from a distance like a glass envelope the al muntaha restaurant with its stunning views across the gulf while below the hotel accessed by a submarine ride lift is the al mahara seafood restaurant whose walls encase vast aquaria
1367,to say that the interior of the burj is lavishly exotic is like saying that coco chanel designed the odd suit
1368,it is quite startlingly luxurious
1369,there are no rooms only suites of which mine was a very lowly variety
1370,it was about as big as my edwardian terraced house just a one-bedroom suite you understand
1371,the bathroom toiletries are herms and you get given bottles and bottles of the stuff
1372,you can tell whos been staying at the burj they trail around in a cloud of 24 faubourg
1373,everything is done by remote control including summoning the butler
1374,ours was called francis and he carefully explained how to use the interactive controls to open and close the curtains and so on
1375,of course i forgot all this the minute he left the room and spent about half an hour trying to open the living-room curtains
1376,eventually i retired upstairs to bed to find that id opened the bedroom curtains instead
1377,the bedroom was so far away up an impressive curved marble staircase past a gigantic chandelier that i couldnt hear the hum of the mechanism
1378,the burj was a fabulous experience
1379,im ashamed to say that i felt a tiny twinge of guilty relief when i transferred to the jumeirah beach hotel
1380,this is the one that looks like a cresting silver wave and its a very jolly place full of very jolly families doing very jolly beach holiday things
1381,the beach waiters even offer to clean your sunglasses for you and there is not a lager lout within 1000 miles
1382,as for the curtains they are operated by the usual pulley mechanism
1383,bliss
1384,it is early in the morning
1385,the sun is rising vast and red through the murk of an incipient sandstorm
1386,im on my way to the oasis stables near the nad al sheba racecourse
1387,suddenly on the outskirts of this city of gold i see the ancient currency of arabia making its majestic way across the sands
1388,camels
1389,scores of them some ridden by tiny boys are heading for the camel racetrack a circuit so vast i cannot see the other side or even each end
1390,when the race is in progress the spectators have to follow it in a flotilla of four-wheel- drives
1391,we halt as the camel caravans cross the road ahead with that distinctive swaying camel gait
1392,but if these are the sultans of swing the thoroughbreds at oasis are the sheikhs of the sport of kings aristocrats whose bloodlines are as ancient as their owners
1393,the oasis stables are part of the godolphin racing empire owned by the maktoum brothers sheikh rashid's sons
1394,sheikh mohammed bin rashid maktoum is the prime mover in the enterprise making history in the nineties by overwintering his british-bred horses in dubai and winning a string of classic victories
1395,we are shown around the stables by trainer nick robb
1396,nick is a world expert on racehorses but if he ever decided on an alternative career he would make a good living as a tour guide
1397,hes a natural
1398,his audience is rapt as he outlines the science that goes into making a horse run from a to b in the fastest possible time
1399,at the end of the stables tour we are taken to the racetrack to see the grandstand and tour the jockeys quarters and the stewards room
1400,this is where the dubai world cup the worlds richest horse race will be run on 23 march
1401,entry to race meetings is free and theres no gambling
1402,but who needs a bet when you can watch the result of centuries of arab equine expertise come thundering down the track
1403,it is early in the morning
1404,a falcon hangs in the sky high above the desert before stooping in a heart-stopping dive for its reward
1405,here and there arabian oryx nibble the shrubby plants that form defiant grey mats in the sand
1406,i bend down and rub the leaves between my fingers
1407,to my english gardening hands they feel bereft of any moisture or goodness
1408,but mitch our south african field guide assures me that the oryx thrive on their diet and points to where tiny yellow flowers have bloomed a response to a short-lived shower the night before
1409,falconry is an arab tradition the birds are pictured on the dubai currency the dirham
1410,in his book arabian sands about oman and the empty quarter the explorer wilfred thesiger describes hunting bustard with peregrine falcons on camelback accompanied by a pack of salukis
1411,he tells how an arab falconer could have a bird ready to hunt in a fortnight to three weeks
1412,at the al maha they have both peregrine and saker falcons and the birds are fed on quail bought from the supermarket
1413,the guests dont really want to see things being killed mitch says drily
1414,al maha means oryx and the resort is another vision made reality
1415,set in 10 square miles of desert nature reserve it is designed to resemble a bedouin encampment
1416,even the oryx have appeared as if by the wave of a wand reintroduced after being hunted to extinction
1417,thesiger doesnt like the term bedouin he says its a double plural and the correct term is bedu.
1418,"he and his 'bedu', of course accounted for quite a few oryx"
1419,the general manager tony williams is a south african ecologist who believes refreshingly that the secret of running a successful hotel is good manners
1420,you should treat people as if they were a guest in your house he says
1421,each guest chalet is arranged to give maximum privacy with its own deck and plunge pool
1422,the interiors are luxurious but they are as understated as the burj al arab is spectacular
1423,theres no ecstasy glitz here but a wooden easel in the corner complete with paper and pastels
1424,it would be wrong to imply that you dont receive a warm welcome elsewhere in dubai
1425,at all the hotels regardless of their architectural idiosyncrasies there is smiling courtesy
1426,"even in the emirates towers hotel a tall sharp pencil of a building that seems to encapsulate in glass and steel dubai's go-getting, thrusting character the service is unfailingly friendly"
1427,however and im sorry to labour the arabian nights analogy there is something magical about the al maha
1428,it has something to do with the pace of life the change of focus
1429,apparently many people come here for only one or two nights
1430,i was told before i came that i wouldnt want to spend more than a night as there is nothing to do
1431,i easily could have spent a week at al maha
1432,hell i could have spent a year
1433,before dinner i sat on the terrace and watched dusk fall over the desert
1434,the dry fragrance of frankincense from an incense burner nearby lingered on the warm still night air
1435,if only herms could capture that and put it in a bottle
1436,decisions on the next phase of the unwisely named war against terrorism are creeping closer and most of the signs are that george bush will get them wrong
1437,after he used his state of the union address to identify the equally unwisely named axis of evil the pressing question is what is to be done about iraq
1438,that something ought to be done about iraq should not be in doubt
1439,the question is whether the us is going to act against its enemies in a way that creates even more enemies
1440,the next question is whether britain is going to support whatever president bush does regardless
1441,saddam hussein is still a threat to his neighbours and - potentially - to the us and its allies
1442,even if the direct risk to the west from his proven wish to acquire weapons of mass destruction is small the international community has a responsibility to act
1443,as mr blair accepted yesterday there is not any evidence linking iraq with the terrorist attacks of 11 september
1444,the country must be treated as a problem in its own right and the issues remain much the same as they were before september last year
1445,the main one is that of sanctions
1446,to his credit mr blair seems to realise that the present sanctions regime plays into saddams hands allowing him to present the iraqi people as victims of brutal us imperialism
1447,the british attempt at the united nations last year to lift sanctions on food and most trade foundered on objections by the russians to the definition of dual-use technology
1448,but it is right to pursue a collective approach through the un where possible
1449,the legitimacy of the aerial harassment of iraq over the past few years has been weakened by the fact that it has been a purely british operation
1450,the next phase of the campaign against various forms of international terrorism ought to be conducted through diplomacy renewing the global coalition - about which mr bush seems to have forgotten already - and working for treaties to restrain the proliferation of nuclear biological and chemical weapons
1451,instead the president seems determined to pursue the short- sighted and negative policy of asserting us might which will provoke resentment and breed more terrorism
1452,mr blair should not be seduced by the collaborationist argument that he will have greater influence over us policy if he expresses doubts in private
1453,he should say loud and clear that us policy is in danger of becoming counterproductive
1454,trouble at bank
1455,an abandoned flip chart in the foyer of a manchester branch of the halifax reveals an innovative policy unusual even in the creative world of finance they dont want customers
1456,"specifically they dont want new businesses businesses that deal in coinage taxi-drivers, window-cleaners, traders and shopkeepers"
1457,napoleon would surely have approved
1458,the company might protest that this disinclination is limited to a number of branches but we doubt it will wash. no business trades on image like a bank and the bank that likes to say no is splendidly irresistible
1459,nevertheless there may well be those who would prefer to bank with a company that refused its facilities to say spin doctors prevaricating politicians most antipodean athletes particularly new zealand cricketers anyone associated with the department of transport interior designers on tv mike tyson or lady victoria hervey
1460,we for our part however would like to stress and emphasise our intense delight in having you as a customer and look forward to renewing our most rewarding association tomorrow and for many years to come
1461,thank you
1462,taxi
1463,the british have never been especially good at providing for their old age and the current mayhem in the pensions industry can only serve to make matters worse
1464,for much of the second half of the last century this congenital failure to plan ahead didnt matter so much because of two saving graces now disappearing fast
1465,the first was the state pension never generous often inadequate but never means-tested and always available to all
1466,the second was the funded final salary scheme for staff
1467,most workers may not have even noticed that they were members of such schemes - to which they often made no contribution of their own - until that happy moment when they collected their gold watch and discovered that they would be on a guaranteed income of say two-thirds of their final salary for the rest of their days irrespective of the vagaries of the stock market
1468,now these two pillars are crumbling
1469,the worth of the state pension was eroded after the thatcher government broke the link with average earnings
1470,the abolition of serps state related pension scheme shortly after also weakened the states provision
1471,since labour came to power in 1997 we have seen a move towards testing and the prospect of the basic pension withering on the vine
1472,more seriously however we now see the move from final salary schemes turn into a stampede
1473,"the pensions watchdog opra says 58,000 company schemes have been wound up and 30,000 of the remaining 110,000 at risk"
1474,prominent names such as abbey national ernst & young marks & spencer bt and j sainsbury have declared their schemes closed to newcomers
1475,the supermarket group iceland is even disbanding its scheme for current members an extraordinary and morally questionable move
1476,this abandonment of final salary schemes is often said by employers to be because of changes in accounting rules a red herring because the schemes are getting expensive true but probably not unmanageably so and because of the chancellor gordon browns stealth tax on pension funds
1477,on this last point at least the companies are right
1478,mr brown took �5bn a year out of the pensions system in the hope no one would notice - a typically brownian attempt to pretend that public services can be paid for without pain
1479,well we now know who will pay for mr browns tax the young the pensioners of tomorrow few of them rich
1480,so without the state or our employers to look after us what are we to do
1481,the answer to that was provided as long ago as 1988 when the then chancellor nigel lawson introduced personal pensions
1482,they were meant to be a portable answer to the one big drawback with final salary schemes - that few of us remained with one employer for our working lives
1483,but the record has not been happy
1484,high charges misleading claims and spectacular selling have brought the industry into disrepute
1485,the governments stakeholder scheme was an attempt to remedy these problems and to encourage the lower paid to take out pensions but it too has met with a lukewarm response
1486,the outlook then is bleak
1487,we are just such very poor savers now with new excuses about the untrustworthy nature of the financial services industry
1488,the answer would seem to lie in the government providing a much more ambitious version of the stakeholder framework that would make private pensions a safer investment possibly linked to an element of compulsion
1489,and we need to recognise that there will always be those who will never earn enough to secure an adequate income through a private scheme
1490,for their sakes the state pension cannot be allowed to wither away
1491,it seems that norman mailer has been uncharacteristically quiet about an event that occurred while he was in england on a chat tour
1492,those interviewing the great man about the new mood of americans were told that we need our manhood reaffirmed every six seconds and this typically maileresque soundbite has a curious resonance in the case of jack henry abbott a convicted murderer who on 10 february hung himself in his cell in a utah penitentiary
1493,abbott it might just be remembered was briefly famous in 1981 when he was the hero then the villain of a dramatic tale of the literary life
1494,a couple of years previously after hearing that norman mailer was working on a novel based on the life of the executed murderer gary gilmore abbott had written a series of letters from marion federal prison illinois about his own miserable life
1495,from the age of 13 onwards he had spent all his life apart from a year on the run in 1971 in an institution
1496,behind bars he had descended into criminality and was currently serving a sentence for the fatal stabbing of a fellow-inmate.
1497,the story that he told of childhood cruelty and neglect of woeful judicial prejudice of survival through violence in the unseen hell of the american penal system was probably not that unusual
1498,the way that he wrote about it on the other hand was
1499,this guy isnt a murderer hes an artist mailer proclaimed a trifle rashly under the circumstances
1500,he collected the letters found a publisher for them and wrote an introduction for the book which was entitled in the belly of the beast
1501,during the fuss surrounding publication he and other writers and actors began to campaign for abbotts release on parole
1502,the book came out in 1981 and in the same year so did its author
1503,briefly abbott became a celebrity in the literary scene
1504,his work was serialised in the new york review of books
1505,his ferocious uncompromising prose was acclaimed
1506,the fact that he was walking free attending book launches and being interviewed on good morning america was seen as triumph of writerly solidarity a victory for literature over life
1507,foreign rights in the book were sold worldwide including to britain where i an editor at the time was the proud publisher
1508,then six weeks after abbotts release something unfortunate happened
1509,while eating out at a manhattan restaurant the newly famous author became involved in an altercation with richard adan a young waiter - an altercation that ended with adan being stabbed to death
1510,the literary bandwagon came to a juddering halt
1511,writers get excited when their quiet existence is enlivened by real events but that was too real
1512,mailer susan sarandon and a few others attended abbotts trial but where there had been enthusiasm there was now embarrassment
1513,those of us who had published the book found ourselves quietly burying it
1514,after his excursion into the world of letters jack henry abbott resumed a life of obscurity
1515,the incident became accepted as a perfect little parable of liberal naivety illustrating the dangers incurred by intellectuals who meddled in matters beyond their experience
1516,opinions of abbotts talent were quietly revised with commentators inevitably quoting humbert humbert's line from lolita you can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style
1517,but perhaps now that abbott is dead it will be seen that there was more to his story than the gullibility of literary types that its real tragedy lies deep within american society
1518,evil is the hot easy subject over there at the moment
1519,anyone who wants to look beyond the labels and the name-calling could do worse than to read the letters sent from the belly of the beast by abbott
1520,i have so far as i recall kept nude photographs of only one author
1521,it happened during the 1990s when someone called elizabeth wurtzel was in england promoting her first book prozac nation
1522,while being interviewed for a mens lifestyle magazine wurtzel decided to be more revealing than is traditional on these occasions
1523,when the photographer turned up she stripped off for a series of unscheduled candid shots
1524,i found the results rather more interesting than most author profiles and for several weeks kept them among my papers for occasional reference
1525,this confession mildly embarrassing as it may be is not in the same league as the kind of revelation on which elizabeth somehow i feel we are on name terms has built her career
1526,in prozac nation she recounted self-destructive adventures with cocaine men and therapy during her teens and twenties which had led to an addiction to prozac
1527,the book was written in heated but workmanlike prose and had she been a bloke or plain or middle-aged it would hardly have been publishable
1528,but elizabeth was a babe
1529,she was prepared to dish intimate details about herself for journalists give photographers a few literary skin shots
1530,the book became a bestseller and its author was described as the voice of generation
1531,the ploy worked so well that elizabeth appeared cute as ever on the cover of her next book bitch in praise of difficult women
1532,she was topless of course but as a small concession to seriousness her nipples had been airbrushed out - elizabeth doesnt have any nipples her publisher told a reporter when the publicity wagon began to roll again
1533,the content of bitch was consistent with its presentation
1534,feminist writing has become dry
1535,i want to make it wet again elizabeth announced
1536,after drugs and sex where does a modern author go
1537,back to more drugs and sex of course
1538,this week a new work from elizabeth wurtzel is in the bookshops recounting her latest addiction this time to ritalin the drug given to hyperactive children
1539,the thought heartless but irresistible occurs that professionally this was a neat career move conforming perfectly to what a publisher wants from an author - the same formula as before but slightly different
1540,what is interesting about elizabeths progress is precisely that her version of emotional porn the hysterical yet glamorising exploitation of ones own darker secrets is so sensationally successful
1541,to judge by a lengthy newspaper extract the new book more now again is no better written than a promising adolescents diary yet its author has been reviewed in time magazine and interviewed on cnn while her book has been serialised in an allegedly serious british broadsheet
1542,a brief visit to one of the numerous websites devoted to her life and works reveals where her appeal lies
1543,a fan heather writes that each large paragraph i devour gets me one leap closer to being me
1544,another message headed a cry for help is from jeanette - i dont know why i cry cant sleep or concentrate but im getting tired
1545,slowly im dying but im still trying at 14 to find happiness
1546,this surely is a profitable new publishing genre in the making
1547,if heather and jeanette are pretty and ambitious they too might one day turn their intimate secrets into literary gold
1548,if as seems more likely they are neither of these things they will at least have the dubious reassurance that addiction is sexy that confession pushed far enough could make you the voice of a generation
1549,meanwhile my former pin-up is offering her views on virtually anything
1550,in manhattan during the attack on the world trade centre she later revealed that she felt not the slightest emotional reaction
1551,i thought this is a really strange arts project
1552,those following her career may form the same conclusion
1553,barrister war hero politician
1554,officially murdered by irish national liberation army 30 march 1979
1555,unofficially a spy who knew too much
1556,unanswered questions was he involved in dirty tricks and extreme right-wing conspiracies
1557,why did he have to die
1558,and is the story about to be revealed
1559,as far away as trafalgar square workers felt the shudder
1560,what was that
1561,was the question repeated across central london
1562,up on the fifth floor of the ministry of defence halfway down whitehall someone instantly articulated the answer
1563,its a bomb the secretaries were told in quiet chill tones
1564,it was 30 march 1979 and the dull boom was the sound of what was perhaps the most audacious attack ever mounted on the heart of the british political establishment in modern times
1565,the bomb planted by an ira splinter group had exploded in the underground car park inside the house of commons
1566,a mercury switch had been activated in the car of the tory politician airey neave as he drove up the exit ramp
1567,why neave
1568,he appeared to be a figure of small consequence
1569,he had last had a post in government in 1959 when he was a junior minister in the transport department
1570,in his current position as opposition spokesmen on northern ireland he might have seemed no more a target than the score of other british politicians who had held such a post in recent times
1571,in fact the life that was brought to an end so violently that day was one of the most enigmatic in modern politics
1572,for airey neave existed in a shadowy world that shifted constantly between the glare of public life and the furtive secrecy of the british intelligence services
1573,he was a man indeed who might be said to have not just a double life but a triple one
1574,next month a new biography of the murdered man public servant secret agent by the political journalist paul routledge is published
1575,it describes neave as the ghost in the establishment faceless and featureless quietly and decisively fixing the course of events
1576,but will it unravel the real mystery at the heart of the man
1577,airey neave was first thrust into the public eye during the second world war when in 1942 he became the first british soldier to escape from the german prisoner-of-war camp in the infamous colditz castle which nazi propaganda had proclaimed to be 'escape-proof'.
1578,it was a schoolboy tale of derring-do in which the eton and oxford-educated officer - who had already been mentioned in dispatches and awarded the military cross for bravery on the battle-field - teamed up with a dutch officer to stage a daring escape
1579,dressed in clothes painted to look like german officers uniforms with cardboard badges they wandered into the castle guardroom and then with the dutch officer chatting in fluent german sauntered past the guards whom they ordered to stand to attention and out of the gate to freedom
1580,from there they made their way through neutral switzerland and thence through vichy france to spain gibraltar and safety in a feat that played directly to the cherished wartime stereotype of jaunty british pluck
1581,after the war qualified as a barrister neave was assigned to the british war crimes team at nuremberg where he served the indictments on goering and the other major nazi war criminals
1582,thereafter he moved into politics and by 1953 had become conservative mp for the staunch home counties seat of abingdon
1583,"war-hero, lawyer politician lt-col airey neave was by the age of 36 already a man of many parts"
1584,yet that was not all
1585,on his return to britain after escaping from colditz he was on the strength of his experience recruited by military intelligence to a division of mi6 known as mi9 which advised on escape and insurrection in occupied europe until the end of the war
1586,neave took part in clandestine operations behind enemy lines helping other pows to escape
1587,so outraged was hitler by his activities that neaves london flat was put on hitlers target list
1588,officially he remained in intelligence until 1951
1589,unofficially he never left continuing to be involved in mi6 as was his wife diana through her links with the �migr� polish community
1590,ironically the couple did not at the time of their marriage know about the others secret life
1591,they found out by chance
1592,"one night i lost one of my agents diana revealed many years later and he was one of airey's, too so it all came out over dinner"
1593,neave was never to lose his taste for covert manoeuvring which proved a useful asset in the world of politics
1594,in the 1950s he had a solid but unremarkable career as a junior minister in the colonial and aviation ministries before falling from favour
1595,he had stood down from his job because of illness but when he returned in good health and asked for a new job the then chief whip edward heath told the right-winger youre finished
1596,for 16 years neave nursed his bitterness and when in 1975 a challenge was raised to heath as leader of the conservative party neave became campaign manager for the rightist contender margaret thatcher
1597,in a tactical masterstroke neave encouraged many backbenchers to think that thatcher stood little chance of victory
1598,he hinted that mps who were not themselves on the right of the party but still felt it was time for heath to go should vote thatcher in the first ballot thus forcing heaths resignation and allowing other more likely candidates - such as willie whitelaw - to enter the race
1599,yet in the event thatcher performed so well in the first ballot that she beat heath her candidacy gaining so much momentum that none of her rivals could catch her
1600,she won and neave became the leader of her private office where his influence - and according to the diaries of the former tory minister alan clark his subtlety and insight - were such that mrs thatcher said that she had been left feeling like a puppet whose strings have been cut
1601,but neaves manipulations were not restricted to the political arena
1602,though the iron lady when she became leader of the opposition offered him the chance to shadow any cabinet post he wanted - and take on the same job when the tories came to power - he chose to forgo the great offices of state and asked for northern ireland
1603,this meant that in an era when ireland was replacing the cold war as the chief preoccupation of military intelligence the security services had one of their men in a pivotal role at a crucial moment in the history of the province
1604,quite what neaves role in the secret service was in the years that followed has never become clear
1605,critics of british policy in ulster maintained that british intelligence became involved in treasonable policies
1606,in 1987 the labour mp ken livingstone used the cover of parliamentary privilege to suggest in the house of commons that airey neave was a co- conspirator with mi5 and mi6 in disinformation activities involving the controversial whistle-blowing spies colin wallace and peter wright
1607,he also alleged that a week before his murder neave sought to recruit a former mi6 officer to set up a small group to involve itself in the internal struggles of the labour party
1608,livingstone's efforts earned him a deluge of condemnation from the british establishment but there were straws in the wind that induced several security experts to wonder whether something untoward had indeed occurred
1609,these were not the wildest allegations
1610,there were improbable tales about how neave and others had a decade earlier planned to set up an army of resistance to the labour government of the wilson era to forestall a communist take-over and talked of assassinating tony benn should he become prime minister
1611,yet such was the febrile atmosphere of that cold war epoch that some sceptics gave credibility to the possibility
1612,this was it must be remembered the time about 1970 when auberon waugh - fed by various sources including his mi6 agent uncle auberon herbert - produced a series of clearly defamatory articles in private eye openly alleging that the former prime minister harold wilson was a kgb agent
1613,even as late as 1975 when mrs thatcher became leader of the conservative party groups of senior tories were secretly gathering to hear writers such as chapman pincher address them on the grave dangers facing britain from the left
1614,it was in response to such beliefs according to claims by the anti-fascist magazine searchlight that plans for secret armed cells to resist a more left-wing labour government were drawn up by a group that included george kennedy young - the deputy director of the british intelligence service mi6 and a notorious racist and anti-semite - and airey neave
1615,"the claim gained unexpected credence when despite official mod denials two former british army generals - sir anthony farrar-hockley, the former nato commander of allied forces northern europe and general sir walter walker another former head of natos forces - confirmed that a secret armed network of selected civilians was set up in britain after the war and was secretly modernised in the thatcher years and maintained into the 1980s"
1616,moreover searchlight alleged neave and young were key figures in an extreme- right group called tory action which was at the centre of a smear campaign involving the secret services aimed at discrediting the labour government in britain in 1975
1617,yet whatever fire burned behind the smoke of such talk what was beyond dispute was that the paramilitaries of the ira - and its splinter group the irish national liberation army inla which planted the fateful bomb under airey neaves car - saw in margaret thatchers �minence grise an opponent of such significance that he had to be taken out
1618,the inla made up of members of the official ira who defected after its 1972 cease-fire and provos who resented their leaders cessation of violence in 1975 justified neaves assassination because they said he engaged in rabid militarist calls for more repression against the irish people
1619,but it was more than rhetoric they feared
1620,they saw in airey neave the architect of a new hardline british policy on northern ireland which would place an increased emphasis on a militarist approach to the political problem
1621,in the months after his death that hardening came about though many commentators would see it not as a preordained strategy but a response to increased republican terror
1622,not long after neaves assassination the queens uncle lord mountbatten of burma was killed when a terrorist bomb blasted apart his fishing boat and on the same day 18 soldiers died in a provo blast at warrenpoint in the worst single-day ulster death toll for a decade
1623,perhaps it was small wonder that when republican prisoners in the maze prison demanding special category status went on hunger strike margaret thatcher decided to let them die
1624,in all this was airey neave the cause or just the casualty
1625,her mentors death may have strengthened the resolve of margaret thatcher not to make any concessions to the ira but it seems clear that in 1979 the new tory government was firmly set in a through policy on how to deal with militant republicanism
1626,the evidence for this is all there in the earlier statements of airey neave himself most pointedly in his call two years earlier for sinn fein to be proscribed as a political party
1627,by this neave disdainfully sought to undermine the republican movements dual strategy of engagement in the democratic process backed up by acts of violence
1628,deprived of the ballot the ira would have nowhere left to go but back to the bullet leaving the british authorities with a much stronger tactical argument against the paramilitaries
1629,there is no such thing as political murder political bombing or political violence as mrs thatcher was later to put it articulating the philosophy of airey neave
1630,there is only criminal murder criminal bombing and criminal violence
1631,we will not compromise on this
1632,was there a similar resolution about airey neaves contempt for those in the labour party whom tory paranoia in the seventies deemed to be about to paint englands green and pleasant land a shade of soviet red
1633,it may now have seeped from the common political memory but there was in those days talk of private armies being formed as a deterrent to any potential political strike
1634,it was not long after edward heaths conservative government fell in the aftermath of its three day week confrontation with the miners during their 1974 strike
1635,field marshall lord carver a former head of the british armed forces later revealed that fairly senior officers at the armys headquarters had discussed military intervention during the miners strike in 1974
1636,and when the labour party under harold wilson was returned to power that year if alarm bells did not ring loudly behind the closed doors of the intelligence agencies they certainly did in the political circles in which neave moved
1637,one of his contacts general sir walter walker - a man who opined there was a communist cell right there in the middle of downing street - formed a group called civil assistance which later transformed itself into a self-proclaimed private army that called itself unison and that claimed to have the support of senior serving and retired british forces chiefs
1638,"another the former sas leader david stirling set up an organisation called greater britain 1975 (gb75), whose members included a jersey-based arms dealer"
1639,stirling who was described by his biographer as well to the right of the conservative party considered the left wing of the labour party as a cancer
1640,"his fear summed up in one of his papers for gb75, was expressed thus why are so many of us blind to an already far advanced conspiracy by the broad left to topple our democracy"
1641,it is now the broad left which harbours the baddies and which is devoted to creating a privileged class of rulers hell bent on demolishing our individual rights and on creating a totally socialistic and therefore totalitarian state
1642,the near take-over of the labour party by its parliamentary left-wing activists in alliance with the trade union extremists poses the most menacing crisis our country has ever faced - more dangerous by far than the worst period of the last world war
1643,this crisis cannot possibly be resolved within parliament alone
1644,it all sounds so preposterous now
1645,but at the time men like airey neave - war hero barrister politician and secret agent - seemed to believe it
1646,just how far he was prepared to act on his far-fetched analysis we may - despite the best efforts of paul routledge's forthcoming biography - never know
1647,at any rate the murderous men of violence of the irish republican movement decided that they did not need to wait for proof
1648,ive just had to change hotels five times in five days
1649,why did i bother with five sets of clothes
1650,i saw everyone only once
1651,always take clothes that are at the end of their life - then you can have the pleasure of throwing them away at the end of your trip
1652,using my bath washing technique youll soon have that case down to carry-on size
1653,at present i am trying to write my first serious novel a process that seems to involve endless displacement activity and i find that if i switch the bill on at 9am on uk gold i am all too likely to be still watching hours later as the schedule swings its way through hospital emergency rooms and australian soaps that would have sent me screaming from the room when they were first screened but that now exert a compelling must see what happens next force on me.
1654,if you watch too much daytime television you soon become aware that the commercials in the advertising breaks are aimed very much at people who to say the least are likely to have trouble with their finances
1655,there are ads for injury lawyers encouraging various mugwumps to try and claim compo for accidents that they've supposedly had
1656,there are loads of companies offering loans encouraging other mugwumps to borrow huge sums of money to buy essential items like conservatory extensions for their floor council flats or their own rocket or trampoline lessons for their cat
1657,another type of ad aimed at the financially challenged is for firms with names such as yes car credit which offer to provide newish cars for people who absolutely nobody else will sell cars to and lets face it car salesmen are not really that choosy theres one interesting feature of these particular commercials - all the blokes in them have big fat wives i guess that they know their market and the only fantasy aspect is connected with the cars
1658,and finally in every break there are several adverts from companies with names such as baines & ernst that offer to combine all the debts that you've acquired from making stupid purchases paying way too much for a reg vauxhall astra and trying to sue gravity for making you fall over into one single loan that you owe them rather than your several hundred creditors
1659,however an interesting sideline that these companies provide is that they also offer to combine all your moral debts into one big moral debt that you owe them
1660,so now i have to drive baines and ernst to the airport every week i have to clean their carpet and i must never ever look at another woman except baines and ernst
1661,i also have to apologise to them for stopping this column for a while
1662,"while doing press promotion for my new collection of short stories which was released in august i would tell journalists interviewing me that with my first collection of stories barcelona plates selling over 50,000 copies and this new one the dog catcher doing over 15,000 in hardback in six weeks i was the most successful short-story writer in britain since the war"
1663,now amazingly it turns out that this might actually be true
1664,i never expected that
1665,of course the fact is that these numbers that i have been bragging about would be considered totally piddling in any other field of the media that ive been involved in but in publishing these numbers denote a major smash hit partly because very few people buy collections of short stories
1666,i think i have finally found the artistic field that i should be in a field where tiny numbers still denote huge success where the minuscule number of twisted supercilious malcontents who find me funny can make a gigantic difference to the percentages of sales figures
1667,once i might have sneered at this but my sense now which has been arrived at over years of an up-and-down showbusiness career is that success is success and whatever denotes success makes you feel much better and if you are feeling good about yourself that feeling is reflected in numerous ways
1668,i remember years ago that i visited a restaurant in covent garden with lenny henry
1669,we had just done a tv show together called ott which had caused a big furore and had been a disaster so big that id returned from birmingham where the show was made with somebody elses tail between my legs
1670,this restaurant we went to made a big deal of its visitors book which they nagged me into signing
1671,a few years later i happened to revisit this place at a time when i had my own hit television series and was feeling on top of the world with a string of awards and massive viewing figures
1672,flipping back through the pages of the restaurants visitors book i was able to compare my signatures then and now
1673,looking back at the first it was tiny crabbed tentative and spidery reflecting my feeble doubting inner state while my second autograph was bold and flowing taking up half a page obviously full of confidence and self-belief
1674,also for some reason on my first visit to the restaurant i had been calling myself les dennis
1675,i dont know why
1676,anyway because i am such a big hit as an author i will be leaving this column for a while to try and write that losing novel
1677,i think its a good time to leave newspaper writing for a while its not like theres anything much going on in the world to write about
1678,sometimes you really have to scratch your head a bit
1679,the economic data have signalled generally upbeat news
1680,industrial surveys are consistently pointing to recovery even if actual growth in the second half of 2001 was rather disappointing
1681,yet the financial markets remain very sceptical with equities lower relative to the end of last year
1682,meanwhile messrs greenspan and george are prepared only to be cautiously optimistic
1683,yes the worst may now be behind us
1684,but no there can be no guarantees of a rapid return to buoyant - and perhaps more importantly - sustainable economic growth
1685,what should we make of these cross currents
1686,there are one or two reasonably straightforward conclusions
1687,first its pretty clear even with a recovery there is no immediate risk of a return to higher interest rates
1688,if there are doubts about the sustainability of economic growth it would be a bit odd to take the risk of raising interest rates only to be blamed for creating a subsequent 'double-dip'.
1689,knee-jerk financial market reactions that point to higher interest rates at the first sign of recovery should therefore be dismissed
1690,second if the recovery is ultimately constrained the inflationary outlook should be subdued for a prolonged period of time
1691,indeed to the extent that activity levels remain below where they should be - either because unemployment is too high or because theres plenty of spare capacity - theres a good chance that inflation may undershoot central bank targets
1692,this leads to some interesting results
1693,at the bank of england for example the corridors are still echoing more to the sound of cooing doves than screeching hawks
1694,underneath all of this however is an issue about recession and recovery
1695,if the recession is shallow what does this say about the subsequent recovery
1696,this is a key question for policy makers today
1697,the downswing through the course of 2001 proved to be relatively mild
1698,indeed as alan greenspan said in his testimony before congress last week the recuperative powers of the us economy ... have been remarkable
1699,clearly mr greenspan is hopeful that the worst is now over and certainly from a data perspective there has been plenty of good news recently
1700,yet he is never one to have his cake and eat it
1701,although the economy did not perform as badly as feared in the second half of last year the us federal reserve chairman was quick to emphasise that an array of influences unique to this business cycle ... seems likely to moderate the speed of the anticipated recovery
1702,of course these words simply emphasise that mr greenspan is a master of the on the one hand on the other hand approach beloved of so many economists
1703,nevertheless he has good reasons to remain concerned about the medium-term outlook irrespective of the recent signs of economic improvement
1704,heres a little story for you
1705,a country has just been through a prolonged boom in economic activity
1706,asset prices have risen rapidly far outstripping gains in indebtedness either for consumers or for companies
1707,the asset price bubble eventually bursts
1708,there are fears of a collapse in economic activity yet initially these fears prove to be unfounded
1709,certainly growth slows down but unlike other countries there is no significant contraction in economic activity
1710,indeed on the so-called technical definition two successive quarters of declining gdp recession is avoided
1711,meanwhile although asset prices come down sharply consumers continue to spend rather than save
1712,now youre probably thinking that this is the us story over the past year or so - and of course youd be absolutely right
1713,consumers have carried on spending
1714,the economy has held up better than expected continuing to outperform the likes of germany and japan and for that matter the uk in the final quarter of last year
1715,and the dollar has remained strong suggesting an international vote of confidence in all things american
1716,unfortunately however exactly the same observations could have been made about japan at the beginning of the 1990s
1717,the japanese bubble burst at the end of 1989
1718,equity prices began their relentless decline followed by land prices a year and a half later
1719,the initial weakness in asset prices didnt seem to do too much damage
1720,true the economy began to slow down relative to the stellar performance seen at the end of the 1980s
1721,however relative to the performance of other countries japan continued to do well
1722,in 1990 japan saw 5.3 per cent growth compared with 1.8 per cent in the us and 0.8 per cent in the uk
1723,in 1991 growth in japan slowed to 3.1 per cent but in the same year gdp fell 0.5 per cent in the us and by 1.4 per cent in the uk
1724,meanwhile the yen began a steady appreciation
1725,i would not want to suggest that the us is about to go down japans path
1726,there are lots of differences - in economic structure in the desire for profit in the flexibility of the workforce in the pace of productivity growth
1727,these imply that america is a lot better placed to deal with the consequences of a sustained decline in asset prices
1728,nevertheless japans experience does suggest that we should be careful in concluding too much from the initial stages of a decline in asset prices
1729,the us may still be outperforming the rest of the world for the time being
1730,but can we really be sure that this story will continue in the years ahead
1731,this question boils down to an issue about imbalances factors that might constrain the ability of an economy to grow over the medium term
1732,one way to think about this is to regard recession as unpleasant cleansing experiences - a bit like taking a cold shower with a lump of carbolic soap
1733,the process might not be very pleasant but at least you come out more hygienic if not smelling of roses
1734,has the us been through this cleansing experience
1735,to date the answer is probably no
1736,the current account deficit is large and is likely to increase even further in the short term if the economy continues to rebound
1737,consumers have yet to increase their savings even with a major decline in asset values
1738,profits have seen the biggest decline in the post-war period and to date have shown no transparent signs of a rebound indeed transparency and profits have not exactly been obvious bedfellows recently
1739,basically we are not out of the woods yet
1740,if anything financial market indicators are pointing to more signs of distress
1741,risky assets like equities have fallen in value relative to safer investments like government bonds and cash
1742,banks continue to limit lending to the corporate sector
1743,the commercial paper market has dried up
1744,these factors all suggest that the current recovery may fade later in the year
1745,the feds shot in the arm last year may have given the us economy enough strength for a short sprint forward but americas reputation as a long- distance runner may be fading
1746,"pain de campagne sourdoughs, baguettes ciabatta and exotic loaves incorporating everything from carrot to olives spinach to sun-dried tomato"
1747,"the supermarkets bakery shelves are chock-a-block, and judging by the mind-boggling variety on offer real bread seems to be enjoying a massive revival in britain"
1748,but has good traditionally made bread really made a comeback
1749,the suggestion prompts tom jaine former editor of the good food guide and author of making bread at home cassell 999 to froth like yeasted dough
1750,most of the bread that masquerades as real isnt real at all
1751,in a tiny way it is different from the supermarket bread of 10 years ago but its no better
1752,ive just eaten a seed loaf from duchy originals that was every bit as nasty as mass-produced bread
1753,supermarket sourdoughs made ostensibly with natural leavens are as insubstantial and characterless as the ones they used to make with yeast
1754,jaine insists that the move to real bread is actually restricted to a minute proportion of the london middle class
1755,certainly a fine crop of good bread shops has appeared in the capital in the past few years mainly in the posher postal districts
1756,the haute couture pinnacle of real bread is represented by poil�ne.
1757,the signature bread produced from the wood-fired stoves of its belgravia bakery the only poil�ne outlet outside paris is a tremendous sourdough loaf of close texture and wonderful complex flavour
1758,this bread is famously the favourite crust of de niro bacall and deneuve - but dont let that put you off or the fact that a loaf costs around 6
1759,weighing the best part of 2kg it will last most families for a week or more
1760,another welcome french newcomer is the paul bakery in covent garden the first english branch of a chain with 250 outlets in france
1761,the baker & spice bakery in south kensington produces equally superb bread which can also be bought at branches of konditor & cook
1762,if you see their san francisco sourdough or potato-and- rosemary bread snap it up before someone else does
1763,the three branches of de gustibus sell 20 fine breads
1764,black forest rye and roasted onion rye are particularly worth seeking out
1765,londons latest and coolest are the two exeter street bakery shops in kensington and covent garden selling italian breads and pizzas perfected by the restaurateur who brought joe allen over here
1766,then theres the 10 branches of maison blanc
1767,but where does this leave real- bread addicts who live outside london
1768,sainsburys claims to be making the right stuff
1769,as part of its taste the difference range two-thirds of sainsburys 300 stores now stock a range of speciality breads
1770,not a bad effort you think at first
1771,the french country loaf certainly looks the part but the crust was too thin and the crumb was too open-textured.
1772,worse still it was so salty that we ended up throwing it out
1773,sainsburys rosemary loaf is vast for 199 but the raisins proved to be few and far between
1774,a honey loaf was ok for toasting
1775,one grain of comfort for non-metropolitan lovers is mail order
1776,the village bakery will ship from its cumbrian ovens any order for a flat rate of 495
1777,you can choose from 17 breads all baked in a wood- fired oven including a leaven campagne and a russian sourdough called rossisky.
1778,you dont actually need computers for special effects as the bafta award ceremony demonstrated on sunday evening
1779,as the stars arrived an unforeseen combination of household chemicals and the worst of english weather added a mildly uncanny detail to the clich�s of photographers flashes and red carpet
1780,a sebaceous slime appeared beneath the feet of the celebrities a copious froth which seemed like a manifestation of some otherwise intangible presence a kind of miasma of ego perhaps
1781,i cant have been alone though in thinking how much more powerful the scene would have been with a bit of post-production cgi work
1782,you can easily imagine a stephen king rationale
1783,a red carpet haunted by the spirit of a murdered extra decides that it isnt going to let the stars walk all over it anymore - and as the more pernicious characters beam and smirk their way into the ceremony a malevolent ectoplasm swirls towards them across the surface oozing upwards over the manolo blahniks and versace dresses to vandalise their glamour
1784,the effect might even win an award - given the current popularity of this kind of visual excess
1785,certainly the lavish digital effects in lord of the rings cant have done that film any harm when it came to handing out the prizes since without computer-generated imagery - or ggi for short - it would barely have been conceivable as a project
1786,altogether there were something like 500 effect shots in lord of the rings overlapped so that it was often impossible to tell where real objects stopped and the purely virtual ones began
1787,.
1788,there are purists who find this depressing - an indication that the long cinematic stand-off between the lumi�re school dedicated to the ethical superiority of unmediated photography and the followers of m�li�s equally passionate about films ability to play with time and space like putty has finally been settled in favour of fantasy
1789,for such people digital effects are the cinematic equivalent of genetically modified foods and the only way for them to guarantee the purity of their diet these days is to go comprehensively organic refusing to consume anything unless it has come from markets too poor to afford technological adulteration
1790,anything from mali or iran can usually be counted as safe
1791,in one respect the cassandras are right
1792,the intermingling of real and computer generated is now so sophisticated that it descends to the level of individual particles
1793,in the film pearl harbor for example real smoke and its computer-generated equivalent were often used in combination to achieve the required effect
1794,elsewhere computer effects are preferred to the real thing because of their biddability.
1795,in black hawk down there was no difficulty in achieving the dust clouds caused by helicopter rotor wash but it tended to inconvenience the actors so the ground was dampened before filming and the real effect added later
1796,the result of course was realism - which from the very beginning of cinema has always been a highly artificial substance
1797,but when it comes to the suggestion that cgi may be fundamentally toxic to the cinematic enterprise its enemies are on weaker ground
1798,true it is currently an overused technology prone to distract its devotees from humble virtues such as narrative coherence and psychological plausibility
1799,reviewing vidocq - the first film to be made entirely with digital cameras - the hollywood reporter offered what has become a fairly familiar coupling
1800,it was it declared visually stunning and stunningly inane a judgement which you might do well to keep on hand for the release of the next star wars movie - shot on digital cameras in three months followed by 18 months of post-production digital tweaking
1801,but this needn't mean the death of art.
1802,quite the opposite
1803,predictions that sound would destroy cinema and then that colour would fatally weaken its constitution eventually proved exaggerated
1804,all those innovations needed was artists who could use them properly
1805,and even now there are signs that the most high-minded directors are intrigued by the ability of computers to blur the distinction between our visual and emotional perceptions to let them write with light
1806,in the lady and the duke the veteran director eric rohmer used cgi to set his historical drama against pastiches of period painting and printmaking rather than a conventional reconstruction
1807,instead of painting out anachronism he used the technology to paint in period
1808,others will come who will make even subtler use of the opportunity to align what they see in their heads with what we all eventually see on the screen
1809,we are in at the birth in fact of the most intensively manipulated cinema weve ever known - and that manipulation will not always be bent solely on making teenagers moan awesome
1810,the battle is already lost but in the end there may be no losers
1811,it would be a pity if celebrations of the queens golden jubilee became confused with the debate about the future of the monarchy
1812,the one looks back in gratitude the other contemplates the serious issue of how the next head of state and those thereafter should be chosen
1813,in our private lives we try to avoid muddling up the two things
1814,we dont say thank you to somebody for a job well done over many years and at the very same ceremony so to speak when the presentations are made and the speeches given loudly discuss whether it couldnt all be done better in the future
1815,we leave that for another day
1816,let us cast our minds back 50 years
1817,on 6 february 1952 king george vi died in his sleep
1818,his valet discovered the body at 7.30am.
1819,it was nearly noon in london before the news could be given to his eldest daughter elizabeth who was thousands of miles away in kenya
1820,she had taken the kings place on a commonwealth tour
1821,a courtier saw her as she was preparing to return to london
1822,she was sitting erect no tears colour up a little fully accepting what lay ahead
1823,the new queen was 25 years old
1824,for the first 11 years of her life that is until the abdication of her uncle king edward viii neither she nor her father had expected that they would in turn ascend to the throne
1825,it was the last thing that her father who loved a quiet family life and had a disabling stammer wanted to happen
1826,he was initially terrified
1827,but the queens father didnt turn away like his brother
1828,he did his duty
1829,the queen has followed this example
1830,this aspect of the queens upbringing and character needs to be taken into account if the many assessments that will be made of her during this golden jubilee year are to be fair
1831,in the hereditary system the task falls to you
1832,your only choice is whether to do it conscientiously or not
1833,even to do it to the best of your ability unremittingly for 50 long years and more
1834,yes if that is how it turns out
1835,when her father was king elizabeth used to look through the windows of buckingham palace at the people and cars in the mall wondering what they were doing where they were going what they were thinking
1836,nobody else has had such a life with its isolation with its ceaseless pressure with its stern requirements
1837,when still only 21 she made a famous public vow in a broadcast during a visit to south africa i declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong
1838,substitute commonwealth for imperial and it can be see that she has fully kept her promise
1839,now i say that for doing a difficult arduous job for half a century the queen deserves heartfelt thanks
1840,on this point it is irrelevant whether one is a monarchist or a republican
1841,indeed the monarchical system is the more unforgiving
1842,we watch and we criticise whomever the hereditary principle places willing or unwilling capable or incapable on the throne
1843,many years ago the queen told her riding master that had she not been who she was she would like to have been a lady living in the country with lots of horses and dogs
1844,how should the nations thanks be expressed
1845,many local authorities remain reluctant to organise or finance celebrations
1846,they are waiting i think to read the public mood
1847,this hasnt yet formed
1848,but it will become clear
1849,at the last jubilee 25 years ago the result was that a large number of spontaneously organised street parties took place all over the country
1850,on the death of princess diana a completely different feeling quickly manifested itself
1851,it was grief-stricken but also cross with the royal family for its cool response
1852,the golden jubilee mood will be i think warm grateful and respectful
1853,street parties may well seem inappropriate this time
1854,that doesnt matter
1855,for the plans already in place are quite sufficient for the occasion
1856,starting with cornwall on 1 may the queen is making a series of visits to all parts of the united kingdom
1857,she finishes in lancashire on 5 august
1858,in the middle of this period will be a concentrated four days of festivities
1859,on 1 june and 4 june respectively free classical and a pop concerts will be held in the gardens of buckingham palace on 2 june jubilee churches services and bell ringing will take place across the country and the next day a procession with the gold state coach will go to st pauls cathedral for a thanksgiving service followed by lunch at the guildhall
1860,in 1960 the queen asked president de gaulle who had come on a state visit what he thought her role should be
1861,he perfectly understood in the station to which god has called you be who you are madam that is to say the person in whom your people perceive its own nationhood and by whose presence and dignity that national unity is upheld
1862,presence and dignity
1863,those she has provided
1864,"even in these days of channel europhoria, our european allies are still some way away from agreeing a joint foreign or social let alone education policy"
1865,so it was quite a feat for the london ambassadors of four major european nations to co-ordinate a joint message to the government and people of britain regretting the sad state of language teaching in this country
1866,their complaint - that british schools are so uninterested in languages that european schools find it hard to arrange school exchanges - was nicely timed to catch the latest instalment of our continuing national debate about linguistic competence which is conducted under the working title why are we so awful at languages
1867,with all due deference to their excellencies and considerable trepidation i would venture another view about the british and their linguistic abilities and i do so from the rare - but thankfully not yet unique - position of being by training a british linguist
1868,contrary to common belief here and abroad a british linguist is not a contradiction in terms
1869,this country does produce a respectable crop of graduate linguists
1870,most leave university thoroughly competent in one more often two foreign languages
1871,their university course will have included a spell abroad perhaps as long as a year
1872,many of these graduates will also have studied two or three foreign languages at school one or more to a-level
1873,the armed forces and the diplomatic service train their own staff in so-called hard languages such as arabic or japanese as and when they need them
1874,these diverse routes to language acquisition may not be the most efficient use of resources but they yield results
1875,british linguists are among the best in the world
1876,when we put our minds to learning languages we learn them systematically and well
1877,i defy anyone to say that a native english speaker has a worse ear for languages than a native french german italian or spanish speaker
1878,where we are genuinely deficient is in making every pupil proficient in at least one foreign language
1879,and here motivation is a large part of the problem
1880,it is not only practical and necessary for most foreigners to be able to speak english it is also - and at school this is crucial - fashionable
1881,however routine and boring english lessons at schools in france and germany may be many pupils will go home and listen to cds or surf the internet in english
1882,london hardly needed the now abandoned cool britannia campaign to attract young europeans
1883,it is seen - even in paris madrid and rome - as the youth capital of europe
1884,that is not the only reason for the sidedness of applications for school exchanges
1885,english is the first foreign language in most european schools
1886,even if all british children learning french took part in an exchange to a french school and vice versa there would still be the german italian spanish austrian dutch and belgian schools that would want an exchange with a british school
1887,there are simply not enough british schools or pupils to be exchanged
1888,many young britons are making quite a rational decision when they neglect their language classes - a decision that has little to do with the quality of the tuition
1889,there are many things that they will need in later life but right now with all the other demands of the national curriculum language- learning seems more of a luxury than a necessity
1890,the first task for schools must be to convince young britons that a foreign language is if not necessary then at least desirable
1891,starting a first foreign language much earlier - seven is being suggested - would at least convey that it is a basic rather than a supplement
1892,british reserve and adolescent shyness also make 11 arguably the worst time to start learning a foreign language in a big class
1893,despite the howls from many of my fellow linguists i also tend to support the education secretary estelle morris in allowing olds to abandon their foreign language
1894,if they have no interest or are not making progress by then it is a waste of everyone's time and money for them to continue
1895,the corollary though should be not just the earlier start to language-learning but the provision of more opportunities in the form of subsidised non-school courses later in life when need inclination and interest might all coincide
1896,to that end universities and colleges should be encouraged to open up their language training facilities to as wide a participation as possible
1897,the combination that i took at school - classics german and russian - is now even less available in schools than it was then despite the promise that big comprehensives would make minority subjects more viable
1898,in the future it will probably still be the few - those whose interest is tweaked by travel foreign friends or a sympathy for language - who form the next generation of british linguists but lets give far more people a chance
1899,every year each student will spend at least 4500 on living costs such as rent travel and food
1900,on top of that will be tuition costs averaging around 3000 over the study period
1901,research shows that an average student will expect to owe around 7000 by the time they have completed their university studies
1902,the case of ms susan wallace who went down to her local with igwig the iguana has lessons for us all that go well beyond the blindingly obvious do not take your iguana to the pub
1903,ms wallace you may recall has just ended up with a conviction for assault and unnecessary suffering - and not to the iguana
1904,lesson one is that even half a pint of lager - the amount ms wallace was reported to have drunk - has peculiar effects when combined with the presence of a rather large lizard sprawled across your back
1905,lesson two which is not altogether discouraging is that men in pubs have a problem with rather large lizards sprawled across ladies backs perceiving them as a threat
1906,precisely what the men found so threatening about the lizard was not actually disclosed in court
1907,was it his claws his tongue his colour his reptilian mien the mysterious smile on his face or perhaps his female companion
1908,which brings us to lesson three
1909,when out alone in the evening you can leave the mace the pepper spray and the rape alarm safely at home
1910,just dont forget the iguana - and steer clear of pubs
1911,poor david warner
1912,one of the finest actors of his generation he returned to the west end last week after an absence of three decades induced by stage fright
1913,his return is to be short-lived after a torrent of terrible reviews and subsequent tiny audiences the producers pulled the plug on a feast of snails in which he was performing
1914,mr warners experience is the downside of some very good news
1915,it has always been said that no one lost money underestimating the lowest common denominator of the publics appetite
1916,that is no doubt still true but after years in which the west end was dominated by musicals or low-brow revues london is enjoying a revival of the serious play
1917,even better most of them are new
1918,audiences are knocking each other over to book tickets for the likes of humble boy the lieutenant of inishmore and gagarin way
1919,producers used to say there was no point in experimenting with new work because there was no audience for it in commercial theatre
1920,that is now clearly wrong
1921,but for every success there will always be failures
1922,mr warner was unfortunate to be in one of them
1923,better luck next time mr warner
1924,one of the joys of modern olympic games is the discovery that yet another unlikely activity - impossible to judge objectively uninteresting to watch or mechanised to the point of absurdity - is in fact an official entitling sport
1925,to synchronised swimming and dancing we now add the freestyle mle for teenagers in search of a drink the bullet shooting at moving targets and of course competitive pharmacology in which participants try to establish if given substances are covered by the ban on epo
1926,little wonder the television audience - in this country in any case - has been so attracted to the like qualities of the peaceful wholesome sport of brushing ice backwards with a broom
1927,no drugs or violence there but it is a little disillusioning to discover that the scottish gold medallists who captured hearts and headlines were helped in their sweeping and sliding technique by computer analysis at the centre for materials science and engineering at the university of edinburgh
1928,it seems the tradition of sporting amateurism is safer in the hands of the youngsters trying to storm the budweiser tent
1929,the rules of war which americas war crimes envoy yesterday declared obsolete have evolved over a century and a half in which the nature of warfare has moved from pitched battles to the horrors of international terrorism
1930,the first guidelines were drawn up in 1864 and revised over the years
1931,the conventions remain the most important international instruments for defending human dignity in war
1932,they provide the legal foundation for the work of the red cross and have been signed by almost 200 countries
1933,these are the rules that president george bushs envoy richard prosper now suggests are out of date as the us administration tries to deal with the aftermath of the international outrage which followed its refusal to allow taliban and al-qaida detainees the conventions protection at guantanamo bay
1934,in the summer of 1859 henri dunant a sometime diarist and sometime merchant was travelling in northern italy when he arrived in the small village of castiglione delta pieve
1935,dunant could not have arrived at a more inauspicious time
1936,that day 24 june a battle was raging around castiglione in what would be a decisive episode in the struggle for italian unification
1937,"the french allied to the sardinians and with emperor napoleon iii at their head faced the austrian troops 300,000 men in all engaged in a bitter and unrelenting battle"
1938,"by the end of the day when the austrians abandoned their positions more than 6,000 men would be dead and 40,000 wounded in what was known as the battle of solferino"
1939,though initially an unintentional observer dunant played an important role that day chronicling the battle and the efforts afterwards by local people to treat the dying and wounded regardless of their allegiance
1940,working from the church of castiglione the chiesa maggiore dunant helped local woman as they did what they could with only the most basic of materials
1941,the effect of this young man from a privileged background was so great that it led him to organise an international convention that eventually developed into guidelines for all countries involved in combat
1942,in a memory of solferino published in 1862 dunant wrote i was a mere tourist with no part whatever in this great conflict but it was my rare privilege through an unusual train of circumstances to witness the moving scenes that i have resolved to describe
1943,"here is a hand- hand struggle in all its horror and frightfulness, austrians and allies trampling each other underfoot killing one another on piles of bleeding corpses felling their enemies with their rifle-butts, crushing skulls ripping bellies open with sabre and bayonet"
1944,no quarter is given it is a sheer butchery a struggle between savage beasts maddened with blood and fury
1945,even the wounded fight to the last gasp
1946,when they have no weapon left they seize their enemies by the throat and tear them with their teeth
1947,dunant wrote of the efforts to help the wounded every family was bent on having french wounded under its roof and no effort was spared to console the men for finding themselves far from their country their families and their friends
1948,the best doctors gave them their care in private houses as well as in hospitals
1949,dunant helped form the international committee for relief to the wounded which later became the international committee of the red cross
1950,in response to an invitation from the international committee representatives from 16 countries and four philanthropic institutions gathered in geneva and agreed on a basic code to ensure the protection of medical services on the battlefield
1951,this became known as the geneva convention for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded in armies in the field
1952,it contained 10 articles
1953,later conferences extended the basic law to other categories of victims such as prisoners of war
1954,in 1899 in the hague a second convention was signed extending the principles to warfare at sea
1955,in 1907 and again in 1929 there were further extensions
1956,in the aftermath of the second world war another meeting in 1949 dealt with civilians and prisoners of war
1957,these last two conventions are perhaps the most important
1958,conventions iii and iv offer wide-ranging protection for civilians and enemy forces taken prisoner
1959,these can include members of militia or volunteer corps they say
1960,they add persons taking no part in the hostilities shall in all circumstances be treated humanely
1961,the conventions say that passing of sentences without previous judgment from a regularly constituted court is prohibited and that the wounded and the sick shall be cared for
1962,they add pows shall enjoy complete latitude in the exercise of their religious duties
1963,henri dunant could not have known that his actions more than 140 years ago would have resulted in such a legacy
1964,it is this legacy that mr bushs representative mr prosper is trying to change
1965,a tempting inference could be drawn from recent events tony blair and his advisers may be losing their touch
1966,by no means deficient in intellect they have been supremely good at manipulation and their cunning has never been inhibited by addiction to the truth
1967,in the past however they have known when to lie what they could get away with
1968,but their judgement now seems to have deserted them
1969,in his handling of the mittal affair mr blair has made two elementary mistakes
1970,he forgot that the cover-up can be more damaging than the original offence
1971,he also forgot that politicians should avoid situations in which their conduct can only have two explanations that they are fools or knaves
1972,yet this is where mr blair now finds himself
1973,when the mittal story broke mr blair and alastair campbell were instantly aware of its potential for embarrassment
1974,yet they have often spun their way out of worse messes and this time they had luck on their side
1975,the story would be competing for coverage with princess margarets funeral
1976,not only that they had a plausible defence
1977,romania is trying to modernise its economy mr blair could have claimed so it is desirable to bring in foreign expertise and capital to privatise and modernise an out-dated steel industry
1978,britain may not have had a direct interest but it is clearly to britains advantage that everything should be done to bring stability and economic progress to eastern europe
1979,mr blair might have gone on as for mr mittal he may not be a british subject but he is a friend of this country
1980,he is also a highly successful entrepreneur
1981,"if the government helps him to help the rumanians, he might decide to invest more in the uk"
1982,the tories seem to be saying that we should not do business with mr mittal
1983,is this because they are racist or because they hate successful businessmen
1984,they have questioned mr mittal's donations to the labour party but he did so because he believes in a british government that believes in business
1985,to suggest that he was trying to buy favours is beneath contempt
1986,this would not have been a perfect defence
1987,the juxtaposition between electoral assistance and ambassadorial assistance would still have left a smell of drains intensified by peter mandelson's success in bringing the hindujas back to the political agenda
1988,he will receive no gratitude for that from no 10
1989,but the blair government could have provided itself with a plausible story which would also have made it easier to explain the european bank for reconstruction and developments decision to subsidise mr mittal
1990,the government could then have argued that the ebrd shared its assessment
1991,"now however the news that the british ambassadors helpful letter was reinforced by a 6m douceur, will appear like the next installment in a tale of corruption"
1992,during his rise to great wealth mr mittal must have brought off many financial coups
1993,"but did he ever manage to achieve such a rapid fold increase in the value of an investment as when he gave �125,000 to the labour party and received 6m from the british taxpayer"
1994,the fault does not lie with mr mittal
1995,he is just a hopeful hustling billionaire
1996,it lies with mr blairs claims that his mittal steel was a british company
1997,unless the pm was a fool he must have known that this claim was unsustainable
1998,mr blair is not a fool that defence is not open to him
1999,when he insisted that mittal is a british company he must have known that he was lying
2000,so what led him not only to lie but to lie in such a feeble and self-destructive fashion
2001,a simple explanation would be a combination of arrogance and na�vet�.
2002,power has gone to mr blairs head
2003,a combination of apparently unlimited electoral puissance and an underlying lack of both intellectual self-confidence and political principle has destabilised him
2004,mr blair has never been much good at explaining his beliefs he no long sees why he should even have to try
2005,recently as was demonstrated over the wreckers speech on public services his response to the rough probing and disrespect which are inescapable in democratic politics was a loss of temper
2006,he no longer accepts the requirement to submit himself to any questioning whatsoever
2007,yet once a premier ceases to respect his questioners he also ceases to respect his voters
2008,the one set of persons to whom mr blair is if anything more respectful is the rich
2009,few prime ministers have ever taken office understanding so little of the british governmental process as mr blair did or thinking less of it
2010,he knew that a lot was wrong with the public sector but he did not know how to put that right
2011,but he had learnt an important lesson from the thatcher years when british business so long depressed and disordered had sprung ahead and recovered its status in world markets
2012,from the outset he was convinced that the answer to any problem he encountered in government was to bring in a businessman to solve it for him
2013,that is a simplistic view
2014,not all parts of the public service are susceptible to the business approach
2015,businessmen are there to make a profit yet governments have to provide services to people from whom no profit could ever be expected
2016,the ethos of business is commercial
2017,to paraphrase calvin coolidge the business of business is business
2018,yet the activities of government cannot all be reduced to commercial imperatives
2019,there is an inescapable dimension of public service and of politics
2020,but as mr blair demonstrated over his handling of the rose addis case he does not believe that the public is entitled to complain about the services it receives
2021,he is also impatient about politics
2022,if he ever did he no longer believes that the answer to political questions lies in the rough and tumble of debate
2023,he believes that he is entitled to call in the disinterested expertise of businessmen and that when he has done so all debate should cease
2024,this will not work
2025,most voters understand business better than mr blair does
2026,above all they understand that businessmen have business interests
2027,the voters have no objections to this as long as those businessmen do not try to promote their interests by exercising undue influence over government
2028,but it will be hard for mr blair to persuade the voters that his business friends do not have access to undue influence
2029,few public reputations now stand lower than neil hamiltons
2030,yet when mr hamilton became a minister he wrote to mohammed fayed and told him that he could no longer involve himself with any aspect of mr fayeds affairs
2031,as a result mr fayed turned on him and destroyed him
2032,if mr hamilton had written letters on mr fayeds behalf similar to the one tony blair wrote on mr mittal's behalf mr hamilton would not now be a bankrupt and would still be a member of parliament
2033,the one inescapable conclusion is that as a government minister neil hamilton was more honourable than tony blair is
2034,after englands overwhelming defeat of the admired ireland - how long ago it now seems - the london press sober broadsheets as much as xenophobic tabloids outdid even welsh supporters of the 1970s in lack of realism and sheer conceit which is saying something
2035,i did not undervalue the victory over an ireland side who as they showed against scotland on saturday can pile up points even though they may be losing the set pieces
2036,what i did do several times was warn against a french team in paris who had already beaten south africa and new zealand before christmas
2037,true several of the young backs who had participated in those wins every bit as significant as englands at twickenham were unavailable to the french coach bernard laporte
2038,but it was still clear he was moving towards the side he wanted despite the disappointing performances against italy and wales
2039,accordingly i find myself slightly in the position of the late politician william whitelaw speaking on the prom at brighton to a friend and myself
2040,edward heath had just told the tory conference that it would be wrong to gloat over the misfortunes of the labour government of the late 1970s
2041,i can tell you whitelaw said that im gloating like hell
2042,it is one thing to be buoyed up with confidence quite another to believe you are the best in the world
2043,it is doubtful whether the england players really thought that
2044,but no one could have blamed them if they had
2045,they were certainly told it often enough over the past fortnight
2046,for this delusion the newspapers are primarily responsible
2047,they fell for the zurich financial services companys computer calculations with all the uncritical enthusiasm of a nine-year-old presented with a playstation on his birthday
2048,a few months ago i was seated next to a suit from zurich at a luncheon
2049,he was a perfectly agreeable companion a scot as many of these insurance coves seem to be
2050,he said that few people seemed to know what zurich was or what it did
2051,hence the companys sponsorship of various activities and in particular its involvement in rugby union
2052,nothing wrong with this
2053,the company wants publicity and is prepared up to a point to pay for it
2054,but the claim that a computer calculation can determine which country is at any given moment top of the world is frankly preposterous
2055,there is certainly a way of arriving at such a conclusion
2056,this is not through the world cup which is partly dependent on the luck of the draw
2057,it is rather through a competition involving australia england france new zealand and south africa
2058,the countries would play one another home and away - something that does not happen in the six nations championship though it should
2059,the competition could i estimate be completed before christmas if it started early enough in the autumn
2060,alternatively there is no reason whatsoever why it should not be held in the summer which in northern europe at any rate is an entirely suitable season for rugby
2061,the championship could be held at yearly intervals by setting the gap between world cups
2062,i do not i may say seriously suppose that such a competition will come about in the immediate future or perhaps ever
2063,but it would be preferable to the somewhat haphazard pre-christmas matches and the even more capriciously arranged summer tours
2064,and it would dispose of pieces of nonsense like the zurich computer
2065,it is doubtful whether england would have won in paris whatever plan they had adopted or however quick-witted they might have been in varying it
2066,the surprising thing about the match was not so much that england did not adopt plan b if there was one
2067,it was more that according to several reports they failed to implement plan a.
2068,certainly it was madness to think as they presumably did once on the pitch that they could beat this or indeed virtually any french side by running at them from inside their own 22
2069,martin johnson foolishly chose to kick to touch near the goal-line when he should have taken the three penalty points on offer - though to be fair jason robinsons try came from one such adventurous decision
2070,on other occasions robinson kyran bracken jonny wilkinson and will greenwood who otherwise had a fine match were all culpable in failing to boot the ball into touch when they had the opportunity
2071,at one point johnson urging this course looked round in despair
2072,i sympathised slightly
2073,the french crowd treated him as if he were the demon poisoner of alsace who along with the presidents african diamonds and the headless corpse in the bois de boulogne is one of the staple subjects of french newspaper stories
2074,much worse things than johnsons punch at vicarage road go on in french club rugby every single weekend of the season
2075,last year the number of teachers resigning from state schools doubled
2076,sarah cassidy looks at how ministers are trying to staunch the haemorrhage
2077,the teacher shortage crisis has not gone away according to official statistics posted on a government website this week
2078,"teacher vacancies have almost doubled in a year leaving state schools short of more than 5,000 teachers with nearly 2,700 of these in secondary schools"
2079,the new figures come in the same months as mike tomlinson the chief inspector of schools warned that teacher shortages have become a real problem threatening to jeopardise standards in schools
2080,and a recent study conducted for the national union of teachers found that almost 60 per cent of trainee teachers leave the profession within three years of entering the classroom
2081,"the number of full-time teachers resigning doubled from 26,000 in 1998 to 52,000 last year with each secondary school losing an average of 10 teachers"
2082,"yet despite these gloomy predictions there are now 7,000 more teachers in schools than 12 months ago and 12,000 more than in 1997"
2083,that is because many heads with healthy school balances have used the money to create extra jobs
2084,meanwhile entries to teacher training in england are at their highest level for seven years
2085,however there are still nowhere near enough secondary school recruits
2086,"teacher recruitment experts warn that the situation could reach a new crisis point in september when a new larger cohort of olds threatens to swell secondary school rolls by around 40,000 pupils"
2087,"more than 2,000 extra teachers will be needed just to keep class sizes at their current levels say teacher recruitment experts"
2088,the teacher shortage meltdown predicted by teaching unions however has so far failed to materialise
2089,schools have not been forced to run four-day weeks but many are struggling with vacancies that are proving impossible to fill
2090,this is because head teachers are using every weapon at their disposal to ensure that children do not have to be sent home says david hart general secretary of the national association of head teachers
2091,heads are relying on supply staff getting existing staff to cover for vacancies rearranging the timetable or even teaching children in large groups
2092,essentially schools have only kept going by relying on the good will of the existing staff
2093,but this does not always mean that pupils are getting a good deal argues alan smithers director of liverpool university's centre for education and employment
2094,staff may be expected to teach outside their subject or the continuity of childrens education could be put at risk by a succession of supply staff
2095,a growing number of supply teachers is being used to plug the gaps
2096,"of the 465,000 teachers in the country around 19,000 are supply staff compared with just over 12,000 in 1995"
2097,john howson managing director of education data surveys estimates that supply teachers are costing schools more than 600 million with agencies taking about 200 million of that total
2098,in secondary its quite clear that the governments training grants and golden hellos are having a significant difference in some subjects he says
2099,however there is still concern that even with the increased number of applications its still not going to be enough to hit the targets in some subjects such as maths
2100,hart warns that this trend is draining schools budgets arguing that the cost of supply staff has gone through the roof
2101,it can cost schools up to 200 a day to hire a supply teacher he says
2102,"one london school has spent �37,000 on supply staff according to mr hart"
2103,supply agencies have received a spate of bad publicity recently
2104,"one agency timeplan, found itself at the centre of a storm of criticism in the wake of the trial of amy gehring the canadian supply teacher cleared of indecently assaulting school boys but who admitted having behaved inappropriately"
2105,the agency had failed to pass on a warning that miss gehring might pose a risk to children
2106,ofsted has also found problems with the quality of supply staff saying that they often missed out on specialist training and were not as good as permanent teachers
2107,tomlinson's 2000-01 annual report concluded they perform less well than any other category of teacher with less than half of their lessons being good or better compared with two- thirds of the lessons of qualified and permanent members of staff
2108,in the most extreme cases the difficulty of recruiting sufficient teachers to teach every class in the school is a major issue
2109,inspectors found that in secondary schools one in 25 vacancies was filled by supply teachers
2110,this was having a damaging effect on subjects including modern foreign languages science and religious education they concluded
2111,schools received their share of the blame for failing to give supply staff enough advice on lesson planning teaching methods and how to manage behaviour ofsted added
2112,the situation was worst in deprived areas
2113,the proportion of poor teaching was considerably higher among temporary or supply teachers said the inspectorate
2114,in schools serving disadvantaged communities one third of the lessons taught by these teachers was unsatisfactory or poor
2115,but the agencies themselves cite ofsted's other finding - that teaching standards in general have never been higher - and argue that supply staff should share the credit for this success
2116,"david rose of select education an agency that finds supply staff 15,000 days of work every week admits that temporary teachers can be slightly outside the loop for the latest training but argues that the agency spent �300,000 on training its supply staff last year"
2117,i think that schools appreciate what we do because they realise that without the agencies these jobs would be much harder to fill he says
2118,we put in a lot of work matching the right people to the right job
2119,we are not just there for emergency cover - we also help head teachers find long- term solutions to fill vacancies
2120,up to 60 per cent of our people are in long-term positions of a month or more
2121,its only really where there is a real shortage of teachers in certain subjects in secondary schools that theres a real problem
2122,estelle morris the education secretary promised to make tackling teacher shortages her top priority when she was promoted after last summers general election
2123,she insists that the governments recruitment and retention efforts are having an effect and plans to 're-model' the profession to encourage schools to make more use of classroom assistants
2124,all the evidence is that what we are doing on recruitment is working and what im sure about as part of retention is giving teachers more support
2125,the money is there but the culture and structure to buy in that support rather than always buy extra teachers isnt there ms morris said recently
2126,head teachers believe however that more needs to be done to make teaching more attractive
2127,the official figures tell only half the story they argue
2128,and the teacher shortage is far worse than even the latest statistics suggest they warn
2129,improvements to recruitment and retention of teachers can only be won by making the job much more attractive both to those already doing it and to potential recruits says john dunford general secretary of the secondary heads association
2130,no one is accusing the government of complacency
2131,according to david hart general secretary of the national association of head teachers ministers believe that the improved teacher recruitment figures will do the trick
2132,the challenge is to stop the haemorrhage of staff from the profession because of stress and excessive workload
2133,if the chancellor does not produce the money to deliver a decent workload reduction package then i believe the situation is really quite grim he says
2134,american computer giant ibm is so obsessed with miniaturisation that it is diverting huge resources into building microscopic computers
2135,the company which spends $6bn (�4.2bn) a year on research and development has decided that the future lies in machines that are practically invisible to the naked eye
2136,ibm will be spending a significant proportion of its research budget on the science of nanotechnology the process of making devices the size of a single molecule
2137,some analysts believe the project will run into billions of dollars
2138,ibms excitement over the potential of nanotechnology has been spurred to new heights by a report by the us national science foundation which forecasts that the global nanotech market will be worth 1 trillion (�700bn) in the next 10 years
2139,that growth will be achieved by making many existing technologies redundant
2140,this will be very disruptive stuff a spokesman said.
2141,the company believes it will shortly be possible to string sized processors together to form a tiny but enormously powerful computer and that it may eventually be possible to shrink the supercomputers that now fill rooms to the size of a wristwatch
2142,ibm is investigating many potential uses for the new technology including the design of repairing materials and machines
2143,another use is producing sensors that can detect infinitesimal changes in atomic structure
2144,this is expected to lead to devices that can instantly detect biological or chemical weapons an idea that has caused great interest in the pentagon
2145,but ibms chief focus will be on the potential computing power of nanotechnology
2146,the group has created a prototype of a transistor that uses carbon rather than silicon
2147,"the different material allows its inventors to produce a transistor 50,000 times thinner than a human hair"
2148,ibm researchers have even speculated that nanotechnology could replace silicon chips and hard disks because information will eventually be able to be stored at the atomic level
2149,ibms drive to embrace nanotechnology coincides with growing interest from global governments and investors
2150,"a us government initiative has an annual budget of $604m, and other countries are pushing ahead too"
2151,if you believe their critics our noble lords have proved themselves supreme lords of spin
2152,yesterdays report on cloning from the lords select committee on stem-cell research gives the thumbs-up to a technique that it says offers real and great hope for a range of common diseases
2153,yet this was the only possible outcome because it was a up job according to the anti-abortion lobby which says the committee was packed with cloning's supporters
2154,the conclusion is indeed unsurprising but for a different reason it reflects the overwhelming weight of current medical and scientific opinion
2155,the cloning issue has been more thoroughly aired examined and debated than any other in science and medicine in recent years
2156,official reports have been published by the human genetics advisory commission the human fertilisation and embryology authority hfea and the chief medical officer
2157,all have backed cloning for stem cells the bodys master cells from cloned embryos or cloned adult cells to produce new tissues for body repair
2158,the courts too have had their say
2159,the pro-life alliance claimed in a case last year that there was nothing in british law to stop scientists from trying to create cloned human beings in the laboratory - because the only kind of reproduction controlled under the human fertilisation and embryology act was that involving the union of sperm and egg which is not required in cloning
2160,the judge agreed and an embarrassed government was forced to rush through legislation expressly banning reproductive cloning
2161,yesterdays decision by the house of lords select committee adds little to the debate beyond endorsing the existing legislation
2162,"by co-incidence, the hfea was yesterday considering the first applications for licences to conduct embryonic stem-cell research for therapeutic purposes"
2163,the coincidence is interesting and the consensus of opinion is clear - there is much to hope for and now that obvious loopholes have been closed little to fear from therapeutic cloning
2164,the uks regulatory framework is among the most sophisticated in the world and has helped us to avoid the chaotic situation in the us where the technique is banned in federally funded laboratories but permitted in the private sector
2165,scientists should be given the go-ahead
2166,enough talk - let the research begin
2167,the ceasefire in sri lanka is a ray of unexpected optimism
2168,the long war between the sri lankan government and the tamil tiger guerillas has been parked in the file marked insoluble conflicts for as long as most people can remember
2169,some of the salient features of this civil war may have stuck in the mind
2170,the tigers reputation as one of the worlds most ruthless and single- minded terrorist organisations
2171,their use of cyanide pills to ensure their members were not taken alive
2172,their early use of suicide bombing including the assassination of rajiv gandhi the indian prime minister in 1991
2173,the repeated failure of attempts to negotiate punctuated by the murder and attempted murder of sri lankan politicians
2174,for the past few years however this has been a forgotten war
2175,most of the worlds media this newspaper included were caught out by the success of yesterdays ceasefire agreement brokered in norway
2176,for all the inevitable cautions this is a moment for rejoicing
2177,it is only a ceasefire with the substantive negotiations yet to take place but it is permanent and it includes provisions to protect civilians from the tamil tigers extortion rackets and press gangs
2178,if it can be done in sri lanka it can be done anywhere
2179,it is too much to hope that ariel sharon will recognise the implications of yesterdays announcement in oslo for his slide into war with palestinian guerillas
2180,he prefers to draw a false analogy with the response of the united states to a form of terrorism which while superficially similar to that of the tamil tigers and hamas is in fact quite different
2181,the conflicts in sri lanka and israel-palestine are essentially between ethnic groups and over territory the motivation of al-qaida is apocalyptic religiosity
2182,as in northern ireland as in sri lanka as in the middle east the only way to achieve a lasting peace is by negotiation and compromise
2183,the experience of northern ireland as well as the fate of the middle east peace deal signed in oslo in 1993 suggests that there still is a long way to go in sri lanka
2184,however for now the new sri lankan prime minister ranil wickremasinghe and the norwegian government which takes its responsibility for the cause of world peace remarkably seriously deserve the warmest congratulations
2185,there was fiction by h e bates and poetry by cesare pavese
2186,renatus hartogs md phd discussed the psychology of hoarding
2187,richard burton and elizabeth taylor talked about their stormy marriage
2188,derek malcolm reviewed a new film called a clockwork orange
2189,eugene schoenfeld md revealed that the principal cause of male insecurity was the fear that their penises are not large enough
2190,there was a special offer of a bikini for 290 and a double-page advert declared that crimplene was the fabric to capture the mood of spring
2191,from its very first issue the march 1972 issue which went on sale 30 years ago this month cosmopolitan confounded expectations
2192,it mixed high art and popular culture and covered diverse subjects - from kissing to getting bank loans if you were a single woman - that had not previously been found within the same covers
2193,the launch editor joyce hopkirk appealed directly to readers - you are that cosmopolitan girl arent you
2194,- and explained who her target audience was
2195,youre very interested in men naturally but think too much of yourself to live your life entirely through him
2196,that means youre going to make the most of yourself - your body your face your clothes your hair your job and your mind
2197,if brains came last on hopkirk's list her readers did not seem to care
2198,"the first issue sold out its print run of 350,000 copies by lunchtime the second was an even bigger success selling 450,000."
2199,cosmo as its readers immediately began to call it had enjoyed one of the most successful launches in magazine history
2200,it became synonymous with the freedom women were enjoying or trying to enjoy as a consequence of the sexual revolution
2201,i was one of those original readers
2202,i loved cosmo devouring it with the same enthusiasm i felt for the female eunuch which had been published only two years earlier
2203,i was a teenage reader of cicero and jackie t s eliot and georgette heyer so i wasnt at all discomfited to find nobel-prize winning novelists and male pin-ups in the same magazine
2204,hopkirk engagingly introduced a short story by alberto moravia by observing that our fiction is a bit tough
2205,but then isnt life
2206,the second issue introduced pictures of naked men under the accurate coverline: our first male pin-up reveals all
2207,paul du feu who had been married to germaine greer was photographed lounging on the floor his right leg modestly raised to conceal his genitals
2208,by the late 1970s when i was working on a local paper in the north of england and pining for london i used to hang around newsagents waiting for the next issue to come in.
2209,youre too cosmopolitan for us a colleague once observed sadly and i took it as the most enormous compliment
2210,some of my friends can still recall individual articles from that period
2211,how many magazines can you say that about
2212,one of them wondered last week when we were reminiscing about the early days of cosmo
2213,it wasnt the advice on sex she remembered but articles on finance and property which inspired her to do her own conveyancing when she bought her first house
2214,"i remember the thrill of acquiring my first bottle of real perfume a tiny phial of diorella, through one of its special offers"
2215,several years later i plucked up courage to leave my then boyfriend with whom i had lived since leaving university after reading an article in cosmo on breaking up
2216,there were pioneering features on abortion which had been legalised in this country five years before the magazine appeared on newsagents shelves the third issue of cosmo explained why the new law wasnt working
2217,hopkirk took the extraordinary step of flagging it up on the cover naming four famous women who had had terminations
2218,it is this no-holds-barred approach to sex and its consequences that many people still associate with the original cosmo
2219,early issues offered 23 ways to kiss a man so that hes yours for life or long enough and things to say in bed
2220,ten years later when hopkirk had been succeeded as editor by deidre mcsharry the magazine was maintaining its image with raunchy coverlines.
2221,but it also had jill tweedie on women money and the freedom to love confirming the magazines commitment both to good writing and the goal of financial independence for its readers
2222,the january 1982 issue offered to take the fear out of fellatio in which the splendidly named avodah k offit md assured readers that oral sex requires only the most fundamental intelligence to comprehend or accomplish
2223,it may not have sounded much fun but she told them exactly how to do it
2224,these days the sexual boundaries have been pushed much further the february 2002 edition of the magazine issue contains bondage tips for beginners - tie your legs with stockings not rope for example - and sex diaries written by cosmo readers
2225,yet the original cosmo message was never quite as libertarian as it now seems
2226,it flirted with the establishment so that jilly coopers 1972 guide to men she imagined would make good lovers included this extraordinary statement on the one hand i fancy robert maxwell because he seems to be so nasty on the other i adore geoffrey smith because hes so nice - and think of the kudos of being the under-secretary of state for defence
2227,its hard to imagine todays twentysomething cosmo readers being able to name a junior defence minister in tony blairs government let alone having sexual fantasies about him
2228,hopkirk herself in what would now be called her mission statement revealed a divorce and her share of emotional hang-ups'.
2229,cosmo girls were she thought prone to aggravations like jealousy envy and a feeling of just not being up to it that hits us all too often
2230,in that sense the magazine was not so much moulding its readers as identifying with them and sending out mixed messages as a result
2231,the first issue included the confessions of a around girl and denied that there was anything glamorous about promiscuity
2232,"if you chip away at the fa�ade, you usually find a miserable victim of shattered emotions it warned frantically seeking shreds of affection from man after man"
2233,the second characterised paul du feu as mellors to greers lady chatterley describing him as an easy-going labourer who is totally disinterested sic in womens lib or any other political cause
2234,another sign that the magazine was not totally at ease with sex was its reliance on american sexologists
2235,you dont need to be medically qualified to explain the female orgasm or how to do fellatio but cosmos contributors tended to have strings of letters after their names and jobs at american universities
2236,this may have reflected the fact that cosmo was originally an american magazine founded by the formidable helen gurley brown author of sex and the single girl
2237,but it also suggests a need to lend professional respectability to what would otherwise have remained taboo subjects
2238,it may also have reflected the confusion many of its readers were feeling
2239,while the sixties is fixed in everyone's mind as a revolutionary decade some of its most reaching effects only made themselves felt later
2240,this is particularly true of feminism which got going in the seventies and was in many ways a reaction to the maleness of the sexual revolution
2241,cosmo arrived at a moment when the word girl was already going out of fashion soon to be used only by male chauvinists or with irony by women themselves the magazine was both ahead and behind the times and had a tendency to preach to its readers
2242,but it treated them as people with the same breadth of interests and ambitions as men
2243,"it assumed they could cope with highbrow fiction and pages of type without the endless cross-heads, photographs and pull-out quotes that are a feature of todays magazines"
2244,it quickly lost its ambivalence about feminism telling readers about the polish trade union movement solidarity and bemoaning its neglect of women
2245,the author of a 1982 piece about solidarity lynne jones was billed as a doctor and a feminist
2246,i wrote for it occasionally myself on subjects as varied as ian mcewan's fiction and the return of the corset as a fashion item
2247,i dont remember precisely when i stopped buying it but there was a time in the eighties when i began to feel that cosmo contained the same articles as all the other womens magazines
2248,it had lost its capacity to surprise and there were new titles with a different agenda like marie claire that i liked better
2249,what seems extraordinary in retrospect is how long it remained faithful to the original concept
2250,by the beginning of the 1990s adverts for cosmetic surgery had begun to appear and the layout was changing to look like other magazines
2251,these days it is more obviously youth-oriented and displays the same obsession with gum celebrities - backstage with britney - as its competitors
2252,"it is a successful formula currently selling 450,000 copies but something has inevitably been lost"
2253,todays cosmo is coarser and less critical confessional rather than analytical and nervous about challenging preconceptions
2254,three-quarters of the magazines readers would like cosmetic surgery according to the latest issue which offers photos of readers who have gone under the knife theyre pleased with the results - you be the judge
2255,of course hopkirk's cosmopolitan was a product of its time and couldnt stay the same
2256,the demise of nova a stylish sixties title that was recently revived then closed demonstrates how the womens magazine market has changed
2257,but what is so striking about the original cosmo 30 years on is how innovative and intelligent it was
2258,it encouraged its readers to be brave to experiment in every area of their lives and sympathised with their dilemmas
2259,it may have addressed its readers as girls but it was definitely a magazine for grown-ups
2260,i thought id reached paradise an empty beach half an hour from the nearest petrol station and small shop car-free dirt roads and locally grown fruit and vegetables
2261,a sign said killing hens and perching pullets
2262,perhaps you have to kill your free-range dinner yourself
2263,i didnt bother to find out
2264,at the store my big mistake was to buy the local newspaper which informed me that michael barrymore arrives in new zealand any day now and plans to visit a local drink and abuse centre
2265,new zealand is a nuclear-free zone
2266,and they've disbanded their air force
2267,is it too much to ask that they introduce a rigorous new form of vetting at immigration
2268,anyone whos sold their story to a british tabloid should be refused entry
2269,then the country would really be pollutant-free.
2270,now the bbc has embraced narrowcasting with its new channels boyd tonkin asks if tv will ever again surprise us with the unexpected
2271,on saturday the bbcs new cultural channel finally shed the dowdy chrysalis of knowledge to emerge as a gaudy butterfly known as four
2272,not all of us can stick around to watch the metamorphosis
2273,after a first night of joint transmission with bbc 2 fours six hours per day of arts ideas and reportage has reverted to the digital platforms still closed to the half of british households who can only receive terrestrial fare
2274,roly keating the corporations doyen of arts who became fours first controller in the new year will be hoping to make his mark in a blaze of light glory
2275,for the bbc a lot rides on the reception of four
2276,greg dyke and his satraps gaze nervously towards the expiry of their current charter in 2006
2277,the long-planned national over from analogue to digital television sets proceeds at more of a crawl than a gallop
2278,to put it bluntly four not only has to recruit a loyal core of arts addicts and documentary demons it must also help to persuade shifters in politics and the media that the bbc licence fee remains the only defensible form of tax in 700 years of british history
2279,four has won over downing street without too much of a battle
2280,the culture secretary tessa jowell green-lighted it last autumn along with the bbcs two digital childrens channels
2281,however backstage ructions from commercial competitors have delayed approval for the corporations revamped youth service bbc three
2282,its no secret that the beeb's rivals - above all rupert murdoch - keenly resent the spectacle of funded empire-building a dozen years after the advent of sky - it seems to presage the secular decline of public-service broadcasting
2283,"with a clever touch of bathos four slid down the slipway at the weekend not with some operatic blockbuster but a dadaist squib a film about the artist michael landy who trashed his 7,000 possessions in the window of a defunct west end store"
2284,it bore the title the man who destroyed everything
2285,as far as the bbc goes rupert murdoch would wish for no other epitaph
2286,the details of four so far announced show why he should never get his way
2287,to be sure some merely fill the glaring holes left by the makeover of bbc 2 into a comedy location for 35-year-olds: a weekly books programme the readers and writers roadshow for instance or the reliably left-field storyville documentary strand and an 8pm news slot with a global remit
2288,other promised delights keep up the grand tradition of gala television peter brooks hamlet from paris romanian diva angela gheorghiu in concert or the africa now music festival staged in a soccer stadium in senegal
2289,yet we already have artsworld and performance channels to do the night folderol
2290,behind the handsome limbs four hopes to offer a skeleton of inquiry and debate in features such as the driven talk show with andrew marr
2291,lets hope that such regular articulations allow the channel to act more like a coherent creature than a frankensteins monster of scavenged art-parts.
2292,as it happens mary shelleys stroke of inspiration on the shores of lake geneva has loomed large in the publicity for four
2293,frequent trailers have deployed the notion of the genius loci to label the new outfit as a place to think
2294,all the hype agrees that this must be a special location satisfyingly different from mainstream tv - a haven for seekers and mavericks
2295,now who apart from mr murdoch could possibly object to that
2296,well you can welcome the channels content while still lamenting the drift towards segmentation and fragmentation that its coming represents
2297,these days we are all the playthings of demography our tastes ticketed and bracketed by media masters who long to give us exactly what they know we want - and nothing less or more
2298,niche culture permits providers to deliver targeted audiences to advertisers with enough exactitude to make sure that a twentysomething urban clubber seldom has to contemplate an ad for a diy greenhouse or a stair-lift.
2299,filterers and packagers devote their time and skill to guaranteeing that we never run across any item that surprises or intrigues us
2300,if it didnt sound too much like the sort of pompous restoration tragedy that not even four would deign to broadcast you might call this trend the death of serendipity
2301,of course the bbc has no fickle advertisers to please just fickle politicians
2302,so it doesnt need to play the demographic game of lure in quite so crude a fashion
2303,the chief constituency of four ought to consist of selecting minorities convened by a passion - whether for qawwali music or quantum theory - rather than by the brute parameters of region age or class
2304,always remember that a large majority of affluent folk take their leisure in entirely populist forms last week we learned that a third of chelsea holders earn more than 50000 per year
2305,meanwhile keating and colleagues vow that bbc 2 in particular will not treat the birth of four as a pretext for an even deeper plunge into show territory
2306,we shall see
2307,in narrowcasting ventures such as four theres a paradox at work that deserves more attention than it gets
2308,since the sixties many of the most exciting pulses of innovation across a spread of cultural forms have come from a push towards fusion and hybridity
2309,creatively confused artists have sought to abolish the distance between lite and popular styles highbrow and lowbrow registers learned and vernacular traditions
2310,look at some of bbc fours early performance slots and youll spot this force in progress bj�rk sings at covent garden fidelio comes live from a birmingham big top an opera company mounts a successful search for new divas in the townships of south africa
2311,tune in to the liveliest american tv so often the benchmark for canny british broadcasters and this pattern stares you in the face
2312,buffy the vampire slayer samples 300 years of gothic visual and literary style and places a self-conscious embodiment of european high culture giles at its heart seinfeld stages his deadpan free-form postmodern jests the simpsons import the dynamics of eugene o'neill and arthur miller into the animated comic-strip
2313,yet while makers of culture everywhere cross boundaries and blur distinctions its marketers labour to reinforce them
2314,audiences are sliced and sorted into ever thinner bands
2315,with the birth of cbeebies even the fives have their own channel
2316,providers track your path through the web in order to deliver the sites your record shows or seems to show you want
2317,newspapers dream of delivering the online daily me edited according to your preferences
2318,a smart box called the tivo will not merely record favourite tv shows but when it knows you well enough anticipate your viewing choice as well
2319,even in the reliably beat book trade publishers and retailers flog their wares under the unvarying rubric if you liked x youll love y
2320,but my haphazard education in the arts like millions of others came about because i stumbled without signposts across z and decided i should spend more time in that place
2321,serendipity - the book picked up by accident the film at first watched reluctantly the magical snatch of music overheard - can shape the lifelong experience of those blessed with such happy accidents
2322,for a brief period so one broadcasting fable goes the single-channel bbc tv embodied this ideal of diversity-in-unity.
2323,plenty of veterans recall it as history while many younger makers dismiss it as pure myth
2324,one evening sometime in the early sixties according to this story the loyal watcher might have grazed through an arts magazine some serious current affairs a gritty commissioned drama half an hour of classic tony hancock comedy a satirical blast of that was the week that was and if they were especially lucky the sight of a j p taylor explaining the origins of the great war with only a bow-tie for special effects
2325,todays brash moguls of reality tv notably peter bazalgette mock this memory as a nostalgic fabrication
2326,they point out with some justice that bbc tv in its golden age was where the decrepit remnants of british music-hall went to die in agony - for the viewers
2327,yet as william blake wrote a truth thats told with bad intent beats all the lies you can invent
2328,the bazalgettes grow fat on fragmentation
2329,they dont want to see a truly varied tv schedule in operation again
2330,so they deny that it ever existed
2331,in their perspective only the big brothers weakest links and pop idols can be allowed the prime-time honour of shaping the national chat
2332,how soon before will young looks old
2333,on the other hand puccini and pavarotti still live in the affections of millions because some inspired producer trampled the barriers and decided to fanfare italia 90 with nessun dorma
2334,serendipity needs a little shove at times
2335,and the bbc brass need to recall that one of their real triumphs in the past decade has been a bobs radio station that flourished despite - or perhaps because of - a higgledy-piggledy brief five live
2336,what will the bbc team choose for this summers transmissions from japan and south korea
2337,madame butterfly might sound a trifle too corny
2338,still some of us can hope that one fine day a television vessel freighted with a richly varied cargo will sail back into the harbour of our lives
2339,motorists who have just passed their driving test may be subject to tougher drive and speeding laws under plans being considered by the government
2340,lower blood-alcohol levels and reduced speed limits were two of 18 possible options in a consultation paper about novice drivers published yesterday
2341,other options for new drivers include restrictions on night-time driving making them drive engined vehicles and the compulsory display of p - provisional - plates for six or 12 months after passing the test
2342,compulsory professional tuition for learners and accompanying drivers skid and motorway training and the introduction of a probationary licence code for the first two years are also being considered
2343,andrew howard the aas head of road safety policy welcomed the paper but added some of the suggestions in the consultation paper are impractical and unenforceable
2344,the aa believes the introduction of p plates would do little to improve safety and it warns that limiting the time when young drivers may drive is likely to be impractical
2345,so long bricks and mortar
2346,cheaper greener options are available
2347,little boxes made of ticky tacky it may have been a good refrain and a fair indictment of a nations love of bricks and mortar but todays house builders are challenging the stereotype by using more inventive materials and building methods at both ends of the eco spectrum
2348,bellway homes is nearing completion on the hamsterley a georgian-style polystyrene kit house which john watson their chief executive describes as a glamorous prefab that is here to stay
2349,he adds we like to explore new technologies
2350,this is a potential revolution in british housing and in building this house the first of its kind in the country we are demonstrating the possibilities from this unique design through to delivery
2351,the bedroom property is the first traditional- look factory-built sectional house made of polystyrene and steel for sale in the uk
2352,its lightweight steel frame clad externally with light but extremely strong insulating panels makes it highly energy-efficient
2353,the polystyrene house may have an sap standard assessment procedures rating of 100 per cent but some builders prefer greener materials
2354,richard scales and ralph carpenter of modece architects worked on a hemp house in haverhill suffolk and have mixed views on the use of polystyrene
2355,mr scales says there are some benefits because its energy efficient but its not green
2356,its using material derived from oil which is unsustainable because fossil fuel will one day run out
2357,the material used to create the hemp house will never run out if the project takes off
2358,ralph carpenters inspiration came from a visit to france where he first saw hemp being used in construction
2359,he convinced suffolk housing society and st edmundsbury council to lead a trial to discover whether hemp is a suitable building material
2360,the hemp houses have been built beside traditional block constructions and insulation soundproofing structural ability resistance to moisture and condensation will be monitored to make comparisons
2361,encouragingly for architects such as mr scales large-scale developers are interested in the hemp house but he accepts the use of greener materials on a mass scale may take time
2362,most of the industry is locked into bricks and blocks because thats the way their operatives are used to working and understand
2363,if you start using different materials then that jacks the price up as they cant do it without thinking which seems to cost more
2364,ultimately the hemp project may revive a crop that used to be grown extensively in britain but it should be pointed out that unlike its notorious cousin hemp used in construction has no hallucinatory qualities
2365,steve clarke suffolk housing society's chief executive says we are hoping that it will make a significant contribution to finding a more environmentally friendly way to create new homes

2367,initially the hemp house was considered expensive although it may prove cheaper in the long term
2368,one building in north london has proved it is possible to produce a cost-effective construction that is also sustainable
2369,number 9 stock orchard street designed by sarah wigglesworth architects is partly built with straw bales
2370,architects sarah wigglesworth and jeremy till who live and work in the house say the building pays attention as we believe every building should to issues of environment
2371,materials are chosen for their low embodied energy straw bales recycled concrete and sandbags
2372,the bale house is a good example of research by design in a project featuring the first approved use of this material in the uk although there is a growing bale movement in the us and its benefits are many
2373,straw costs �1.50p per bale delivered to central london is widely available easy to build with and provides good thermal insulation because it breathes
2374,the architects installed the bales with friends and family
2375,standard practice is to render the bales on both sides but here the architects have clad the building on the outside with a rain screen
2376,having ensured the walls are carefully detailed to keep out vermin and water - both things that would otherwise lead to a short life they add
2377,the tension between the roughness of the bales and the sleek exterior of the film sheathing disturbs the normal architectural categories uniting the slick with the hairy
