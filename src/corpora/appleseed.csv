1,if you happened to find yourself on the banks of the ohio river on a particular afternoon in the spring of 1806 somewhere just to the north of wheeling west virginia say you would probably have noticed a strange makeshift craft drifting lazily down the river
2,at the time this particular stretch of the ohio wide and brown and bounded on both sides by steep shoulders of land thick with oaks and hickories fairly boiled with river traffic as a ramshackle armada of keelboats and barges ferried settlers from the comparative civilization of pennsylvania to the wilderness of the northwest territory
3,the peculiar craft you d have caught sight of that afternoon consisted of a pair of hollowed out logs that had been lashed together to form a rough catamaran a sort of canoe plus sidecar
4,in one of the dugouts lounged the figure of a skinny man of about thirty who may or may not have been wearing a burlap coffee sack for a shirt and a tin pot for a hat
5,according to the man in jefferson county who deemed the scene worth recording the fellow in the canoe appeared to be snoozing without a care in the world evidently trusting in the river to take him wherever it was he wanted to go
6,the other hull his sidecar was riding low in the water under the weight of a small mountain of seeds that had been carefully blanketed with moss and mud to keep them from drying out in the sun
7,the fellow snoozing in the canoe was john chapman already well known to people in ohio by his nickname johnny appleseed
8,he was on his way to marietta where the muskingum river pokes a big hole into the ohio s northern bank pointing straight into the heart of the northwest territory
9,chapman s plan was to plant a tree nursery along one of that river s as yet unsettled tributaries which drain the fertile thickly forested hills of central ohio as far north as mansfield
10,in all likelihood chapman was coming from allegheny county in western pennsylvania to which he returned each year to collect apple seeds separating them out from the fragrant mounds of pomace that rose by the back door of every cider mill
11,a single bushel of apple seeds would have been enough to plant more than three hundred thousand trees there s no way of telling how many bushels of seed chapman had in tow that day but it s safe to say his catamaran was bearing several whole orchards into the wilderness
12,the image of john chapman and his heap of apple seeds riding together down the ohio has stayed with me since i first came across it a few years ago in an out of print biography
13,the scene for me has the resonance of myth a myth about how plants and people learned to use each other each doing for the other things they could not do for themselves in the bargain changing each other and improving their common lot
14,henry david thoreau once wrote that it is remarkable how closely the history of the apple tree is connected with that of man and much of the american chapter of that story can be teased out of chapman s story
15,it s the story of how pioneers like him helped domesticate the frontier by seeding it with old world plants
16,exotics we re apt to call these species today in disparagement yet without them the american wilderness might never have become a home
17,what did the apple get in return a golden age untold new varieties and half a world of new habitat
18,of the man lounging in the two hulled canoe robert price his biographer wrote that he had the thick bark of queerness on him
19,indeed
20,a man with no fixed address his entire adult life chapman preferred to spend his nights out of doors one winter he set up house in a hollowed out sycamore stump outside defiance ohio where he operated a pair of nurseries
21,a vegetarian living on the frontier he deemed it a cruelty to ride a horse or chop down a tree he once punished his own foot for squashing a worm by throwing away its shoe
22,he liked best the company of indians and children and rumors trailed him to the effect that he d once been engaged to marry a ten year old girl who d broken his heart
23,price feels compelled to assure his readers that chapman was not a complete crank
24,the emphasis is mine
25,i d brought a copy of price s 1954 biography with me to ohio and i relied on its maps to retrace appleseed s annual migration from western pennsylvania in search of seeds to his far flung properties in ohio and eventually indiana
26,it was price s account that had led me to the spot where chapman first crossed the river into ohio in a faded microscopic burg to the south of steubenville called brilliant
27,the residents of brilliant had urged chapman to stay and plant a nursery but by his lights the place was already overdeveloped
28,ever since he d come west from longmeadow massachusetts in 1797 at the age of twenty three chapman had shied away from settled places for reasons of both temperament and business
29,to people in brilliant chapman explained that he preferred to get out ahead of the settlers moving west and this would become the pattern of his life planting a nursery on a tract of wilderness he judged ripe for settlement and then waiting
30,by the time the settlers arrived he d have apple trees ready to sell them
31,in time he would find a local boy to look after his trees move on and start the process all over again
32,by the 1830s john chapman was operating a chain of nurseries that reached all the way from western pennsylvania through central ohio and into indiana
33,it was in fort wayne that chapman died in 1845 wearing the infamous coffee sack some say yet leaving an estate that included some 1 200 acres of prime real estate
34,the barefoot crank died a wealthy man
35,sketchy though they were the biographical facts were enough to make anyone question the saintly golden books version of johnny appleseed the child bride but it was a single botanical fact about the seeds themselves that made me realize that his story had been lost and probably on purpose
36,the fact simply is this apples don t come true from seeds that is an apple tree grown from a seed will be a wildling bearing little resemblance to its parent
37,anyone who wants edible apples plants grafted trees for the fruit of seedling apples is almost always inedible sour enough thoreau once wrote to set a squirrel s teeth on edge and make a jay scream
38,thoreau claimed to like the taste of such apples but most of his countrymen judged them good for little but hard cider and hard cider was the fate of most apples grown in america up until prohibition
39,apples were something people drank
40,the reason people in brilliant wanted john chapman to stay and plant a nursery was the same reason he would soon be welcome in every cabin in ohio johnny appleseed was bringing the gift of alcohol to the frontier
41,the identification of the apple with notions of health and wholesomeness turns out to be a modern invention part of a public relations campaign dreamed up by the apple industry in the early 1900s to reposition a fruit that the women s christian temperance union had declared war on
42,carry nation s hatchet it seems was meant not just for saloon doors but for chopping down the very apple trees john chapman had planted by the millions
43,that hatchet or at least prohibition is probably responsible for the bowdlerizing of chapman s story
44,johnny appleseed was revered on the frontier for a great many admirable qualities he was a philanthropist a healer an evangelist of a doctrine veering perilously close to pantheism a peacemaker with the indians
45,yet as i looked out at the sluggish brown ohio sliding west trying to picture the man in rags riding alongside his cargo of cider seeds i wondered if all the cultural energy spent painting chapman as a christian saint wasn t really just an attempt to domesticate a far stranger more pagan hero
46,maybe in ohio i could catch a glimpse of his former wildness
47,his and the apple s both
48,slice an apple through at its equator and you will find five small chambers arrayed in a perfectly symmetrical starburst a pentagram
49,each of the chambers holds a seed occasionally two of such a deep lustrous brown they might have been oiled and polished by a woodworker
50,two facts about these seeds are worth noting
51,first they contain a small quantity of cyanide probably a defense the apple evolved to discourage animals from biting into them they re almost indescribably bitter
52,the second more important fact about those seeds concerns their genetic contents which are likewise full of surprises
53,every seed in that apple not to mention every seed riding down the ohio alongside john chapman contains the genetic instructions for a completely new and different apple tree one that if planted would bear only the most glancing resemblance to its parents
54,if not for grafting the ancient technique of cloning trees every apple in the world would be its own distinct variety and it would be impossible to keep a good one going beyond the life span of that particular tree
55,in the case of the apple the fruit nearly always falls far from the tree
56,the botanical term for this variability is heterozygosity and while there are many species that share it our own included in the apple the tendency is extreme
57,more than any other single trait it is the apple s genetic variability its ineluctable wildness that accounts for its ability to make itself at home in places as different from one another as new england and new zealand kazakhstan and california
58,wherever the apple tree goes its offspring propose so many different variations on what it means to be an apple at least five per apple several thousand per tree that a couple of these novelties are almost bound to have whatever qualities it takes to prosper in the tree s adopted home
59,exactly where the apple started out from has long been a matter of contention among people who have studied these things but it appears that the ancestor of malus domestica the domesticated apple is a wild apple that grows in the mountains of kazakhstan
60,in some places there malus sieversii as it s known to botanists is the dominant species in the forest growing to a height of sixty feet and throwing off each fall a cornucopia of odd applelike fruits ranging in size from marbles to softballs in color from yellow and green to red and purple
61,i ve tried to imagine what may in such a forest must look and smell like or october with the forest floor a nubby carpet of reds and golds and greens
62,the silk route traverses some of these forests and it seems likely that travelers passing through would have picked the biggest and tastiest of these fruits to take with them on their journey west
63,along the way seeds were dropped wildlings sprouted and malus hybridized freely with related species such as the european crab apples eventually producing millions of novel apple types all through asia and europe
64,most of these would have yielded unpalatable fruit though even these trees would have been worth growing for cider or forage
65,true domestication had to await the invention of grafting by the chinese
66,sometime in the second millennium b
67,c
68,the chinese discovered that a slip of wood cut from a desirable tree could be notched into the trunk of another tree once this graft took the fruit produced on new wood growing out from that juncture would share the characteristics of its more desirable parent
69,this technique is what eventually allowed the greeks and romans to select and propagate the choicest specimens
70,at this point the apple seems to have settled down for a while
71,according to pliny the romans cultivated twenty three different varieties of apples some of which they took with them to england
72,the tiny oblate lady apple which still shows up in markets at christmastime is thought to be one of these
73,as thoreau suggested in an 1862 essay in praise of wild apples this most civilized of trees followed the westward course of empire from the ancient world to europe and then on to america with the early settlers
74,much like the puritans who regarded their crossing to america as a kind of baptism or rebirth the apple couldn t cross the atlantic without changing its identity a fact that encouraged generations of americans to hear echoes of their own story in the story of this fruit
75,the apple in america became a parable
76,the earliest immigrants to america had brought grafted old world apple trees with them but in general these trees fared poorly in their new home
77,harsh winters killed off many of them outright the fruit of others was nipped in the bud by late spring frosts unknown in england
78,but the colonists also planted seeds often saved from apples eaten during their atlantic passage and these seedling trees called pippins eventually prospered especially after the colonists imported honeybees to improve pollination which had been spotty at first
79,ben franklin reported that by 1781 the fame of the newtown pippin a homegrown apple discovered in a flushing new york cider orchard had already spread to europe
80,in effect the apple like the settlers themselves had to forsake its former domestic life and return to the wild before it could be reborn as an american as newtown pippins and baldwins golden russets and jonathans
81,this is what the seeds on john chapman s boat were doing
82,it may also be what chapman was doing
83,by reverting to wild ways to sexual reproduction that is and going to seed the apple was able to reach down into its vast store of genes accumulated over the course of its travels through asia and europe and discover the precise combination of traits required to survive in the new world
84,the apple probably also found some of what it needed by hybridizing with the wild american crabs which are the only native american apple trees
85,thanks to the species inherent prodigality coupled with the work of individuals like john chapman in a remarkably short period of time the new world had its own apples adapted to the soil and climate and day length of north america apples that were as distinct from the old european stock as the americans themselves
86,in 1801 one of the things you could buy in marietta before heading into the interior was apple trees
87,soon after his arrival rufus putnam had himself planted a nursery on the opposite bank of the ohio so that he might sell trees to the pioneers passing through
88,what was surprising about this was that the apples putnam sold were not grown from seeds they were grafted trees
89,in fact his nursery offered a selection of the well known eastern varieties the roxbury russets newtown pippins and early chandlers that had already made their names in colonial new england
90,what this meant of course was that john chapman s apples were neither the first in ohio nor by any stretch the best for his were seedling trees exclusively
91,chapman somewhat perversely would have nothing to do with grafted trees
92,they can improve the apple in that way he s supposed to have said but that is only a device of man and it is wicked to cut up trees that way
93,the correct method is to select good seeds and plant them in good ground and god only can improve the apple
94,so what exactly was unique about chapman s operation and why did it succeed apart from his almost fanatical devotion to apples planted from seed his business was distinguished by its portability his willingness to pack up and move his apple tree operation to keep pace with the ever shifting frontier
95,like a shrewd real estate developer which is one way to describe him chapman had a sixth sense for exactly where the next wave of development was about to break
96,there he would go and plant his seeds on a tract of waterfront land sometimes paid for sometimes not confident in the expectation that a few years hence a market for his trees would appear at his doorstep
97,by the time the settlers came he d have two to three year old trees ready for sale at six and a half cents apiece
98,chapman was evidently the only appleman on the american frontier pursuing such a strategy
99,it would have large consequences for both the frontier and the apple
100,if a man had the temperament for it and didn t care about starting a family or putting down roots selling apple trees along the shifting edge of the frontier was not a bad little business
101,apples were precious on the frontier and chapman could be sure of a strong demand for his seedlings even if most of them would yield nothing but spitters
102,he was selling cheaply something everybody wanted something in fact everybody in ohio needed by law
103,a land grant in the northwest territory specifically required a settler to set out at least fifty apple or pear trees as a condition of his deed
104,the purpose of the rule was to dampen real estate speculation by encouraging homesteaders to put down roots
105,since a standard apple tree normally took ten years to fruit an orchard was a mark of lasting settlement
106,that s one reason planting an orchard became one of the earliest ceremonies of settlement on the american frontier the other was the apples themselves
107,it takes a leap of the historical imagination to appreciate just how much the apple meant to people living two hundred years ago
108,by comparison the apple in our eye is a fairly inconsequential thing a popular fruit second only to the banana but nothing we can t imagine living without
109,it is much harder for us to imagine living without the experience of sweetness however and sweetness in the widest oldest sense is what the apple offered an american in chapman s time the desire it helped gratify
110,sugar was a rarity in eighteenth century america
111,even after cane plantations were established in the caribbean it remained a luxury good beyond the reach of most americans
112,later on cane sugar became so closely identified with the slave trade that many americans avoided buying it on principle
113,before the english arrived and for some time after there were no honeybees in north america therefore no honey to speak of for a sweetener indians in the north had relied on maple sugar instead
114,it wasn t until late in the nineteenth century that sugar became plentiful and cheap enough to enter the lives of very many americans and most of them lived on the eastern seaboard before then the sensation of sweetness in the lives of most people came chiefly from the flesh of fruit
115,and in america that usually meant the apple
116,sweetness is a desire that starts on the tongue with the sense of taste but it doesn t end there
117,or at least it didn t end there back when the experience of sweetness was so special that the word served as a metaphor for a certain kind of perfection
118,when writers like jonathan swift and matthew arnold used the expression sweetness and light to name their highest ideal swift called them the two noblest of things arnold the ultimate aim of civilization they were drawing on a sense of the word sweetness going back to classical times a sense that has largely been lost to us
119,the best land was said to be sweet so were the most pleasing sounds the most persuasive talk the loveliest views the most refined people and the choicest part of any whole as when shakespeare calls spring the sweet o the year
120,lent by the tongue to all the other sense organs sweet in the somewhat archaic definition of the oxford english dictionary is that which affords enjoyment or gratifies desire
121,like a shimmering equal sign the word sweetness denoted a reality commensurate with human desire it stood for fulfillment
122,since then sweetness has lost much of its power and become slightly well saccharine
123,who now would think of sweetness as a noble quality at some point during the nineteenth century a hint of insincerity began to trail the word through literature and in our time it s usually shadowed by either irony or sentimentality
124,overuse probably helped to cheapen the word s power on the tongue but i think the advent of cheap sugar in europe and perhaps especially cane sugar produced by slaves is what did the most to discount sweetness both as an experience and as a metaphor
125,the final insult came with the invention of synthetic sweeteners
126,both the experience and the metaphor seem to me worth recovering if for no other reason than to appreciate the apple s former power
127,start with the taste
128,imagine a moment when the sensation of honey or sugar on the tongue was an astonishment a kind of intoxication
129,the closest i ve ever come to recovering such a sense of sweetness was secondhand though it left a powerful impression on me even so
130,i m thinking of my son s first experience of sugar the icing on the cake at his first birthday
131,i have only the testimony of isaac s face to go by that and his fierceness to repeat the experience but it was plain that his first encounter with sugar had intoxicated him was in fact an ecstasy in the literal sense of that word
132,that is he was beside himself with the pleasure of it no longer here with me in space and time in quite the same way he had been just a moment before
133,between bites isaac gazed up at me in amazement he was on my lap and i was delivering the ambrosial forkfuls to his gaping mouth as if to exclaim your world contains this from this day forward i shall dedicate my life to it
134,which he basically has done
135,and i remember thinking this is no minor desire and then wondered could it be that sweetness is the prototype of all desire
136,alcohol is of course the other great beneficence of sugar it is made by encouraging certain yeasts to dine on the sugars manufactured in plants
137,fermentation converts the glucose in plants into ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide
138,the sweetest fruit makes the strongest drink and in the north where grapes didn t do well that was usually the apple
139,up until prohibition an apple grown in america was far less likely to be eaten than to wind up in a barrel of cider
140,hard cider is a twentieth century term redundant before then since virtually all cider was hard until modern refrigeration allowed people to keep sweet cider sweet
141,corn liquor or white lightning preceded cider on the frontier by a few years but after the apple trees began to bear fruit cider being safer tastier and much easier to make became the alcoholic drink of choice
142,just about the only reason to plant an orchard of the sort of seedling apples john chapman had for sale would have been its intoxicating harvest of drink available to anyone with a press and a barrel
143,allowed to ferment for a few weeks pressed apple juice yields a mildly alcoholic beverage with about half the strength of wine
144,for something stronger the cider can then be distilled into brandy or simply frozen the intensely alcoholic liquid that refuses to ice is called applejack
145,hard cider frozen to thirty degrees below zero yields an applejack of 66 proof
146,virtually every homestead in america had an orchard from which literally thousands of gallons of cider were made every year
147,in rural areas cider took the place not only of wine and beer but of coffee and tea juice and even water
148,indeed in many places cider was consumed more freely than water even by children since it was arguably the healthier because more sanitary beverage
149,cider became so indispensable to rural life that even those who railed against the evil of alcohol made an exception for cider and the early prohibitionists succeeded mainly in switching drinkers over from grain to apple spirits
150,eventually they would attack cider directly and launch their campaign to chop down apple trees but up until the end of the nineteenth century cider continued to enjoy the theological exemption the puritans had contrived for it
151,it wasn t until this century that the apple acquired its reputation for wholesomeness an apple a day keeps the doctor away was a marketing slogan dreamed up by growers concerned that temperance would cut into sales
152,in 1900 the horticulturist liberty hyde bailey wrote that the eating of the apple rather than the drinking of it has come to be paramount but for the two centuries before that whenever an american extolled the virtues of the apple whether it was john winthrop or thomas jefferson henry ward beecher or john chapman their contemporaries would probably have smiled knowingly hearing in their words a distinct dionysian echo that we are apt to miss
153,when emerson for instance wrote that man would be more solitary less friended less supported if the land yielded only the useful maize and potato and withheld this ornamental and social fruit his readers understood it was the support and sociability of alcohol he had in mind
154,americans inclination toward cider is the only way to explain john chapman s success how the man could have made a living selling spitters to ohio settlers when there were already grafted trees bearing edible fruit for sale in marietta
155,chapman lived everywhere and nowhere
156,he was constantly on the move traveling in autumn to allegheny county to gather seeds scouting nursery sites and planting in the spring repairing fences at old nurseries in summer and wherever he planted signing up local agents to keep an eye on and sell his trees since he was seldom in one place long enough to do that work himself
157,even into his sixties after moving his base of operations to indiana chapman made an annual pilgrimage to central ohio to look after his nurseries there
158,his absentee management meant he was frequently gypped and his land claims were often jumped though whenever this happened chapman s main concern seems to have been for the welfare of his trees
159,in spite of these setbacks he managed to accumulate enough cash to build up his real estate holdings and give money away to people in need frequently strangers
160,as bill pointed out the size of his estate which included some twenty two parcels of land is hard to square with the notion that he was feebleminded or feckless
161,swedenborgian doctrine which holds that everything here on earth corresponds directly to something in the afterlife might explain the strange and wonderful ways chapman conducted himself in nature
162,the same landscape his countrymen treated as hostile heathen and therefore theirs to conquer chapman regarded as beneficent in every particular in his eyes even the lowliest worm glowed with divine purpose
163,his kindness to animals was notorious an outrage to frontier custom
164,it was said he d sooner douse his campfire than singe the mosquitoes attracted to its flame
165,chapman often used his profits to purchase lame horses to save them from slaughter and once he freed a wolf he found snared in a trap nursing the animal to health and then keeping it as a pet
166,when he discovered one evening that the hollowed out log in which he intended to spend the night was already occupied by bear cubs he let them be making his bed in the snow instead
167,chapman could sleep anywhere it seems though he was partial to hollowed out logs or a hammock slung between two trees
168,one time he floated a hundred miles down the allegheny on a block of ice sleeping the whole way
169,curiously a great many stories about chapman have to do with his feet how he d go barefoot in any weather the time he punished his foot for stepping on a worm or in some versions a snake
170,he would entertain boys by pressing needles or hot coals into the soles of his feet which had grown as horny and tough as an elephant s
171,ripe for ridicule though he must have been boys were so awed by his fortitude that they never made fun of him
172,listening to an itinerant preacher in mansfield pound his tree stump pulpit and ask one too many times where now is there a man who like the primitive christians is traveling to heaven barefoot and clad in coarse raiments chapman roused himself from the log he was reclining against and planted his bare ugly foot square in the middle of the preacher s stump
173,here s your primitive christian the recurring barefoot theme underscores the sense people had that chapman s relationship to nature was special and not quite human
174,the soles of our shoes interpose a protective barrier between us and the earth that chapman had no use for if shoes are part and parcel of a civilized life chapman had one foot planted in another realm had at least that much in common with the animals
175,whenever i hear or read about chapman s horny bare feet i can t help picturing him as some kind of satyr or centaur
176,but in spite of his peculiar attire and personal habits those who knew him said he was never repulsive
177,people were happy to have him as a guest in their homes and parents would let him bounce their babies on his lap
178,as far as i know john chapman never set foot in geneva new york but there is an orchard there where i caught my last and in some ways most vivid glimpse of him
179,here on the banks of seneca lake in excellent apple growing country a government outfit called the plant genetic resources unit maintains the world s largest collection of apple trees
180,some 2 500 different varieties have been gathered from all over the world and set out here in pairs as if on a beached botanical ark
181,the card catalog of this fifty acre tree archive runs the pomological gamut from adam s pearmain an antique english apple to the german zucalmagio
182,in between a browser will find almost every variety discovered in america since the roxbury russet distinguished itself in a cider orchard outside boston in 1645
183,the geneva orchard is among other things a museum of the apple s golden age in america and a few weeks after my trip to the midwest i traveled here alone to see what of johnny appleseed s legacy i might find in its corridors
184,at first glance the orchard looks much like any other the tidy rows of grafted trees advancing like rails to the horizon
185,but it doesn t take long before you begin to notice the stupendous variety of these trees in color leaf and branching habit and the metaphor of a library begins to fit endless shelves of books that are alike only superficially
186,the golden age of american apples that john chapman helped to underwrite lives on in the geneva orchard yet just about no place else
187,in fact the sole reason for its existence is that these erstwhile giants of the young american orchard the actual and metaphorical descendants of appleseed s apple seeds have been all but killed off by the dominance of a few commercially important apples that and a pinched modern idea of what constitutes sweetness
188,a far more brutal winnowing of the apple s prodigious variability took place around the turn of the century
189,that s when the temperance movement drove cider underground and cut down the american cider orchard that wildness preserve and riotous breeding ground of apple originality
190,americans began to eat rather than drink their apples thanks in part to a pr slogan an apple a day keeps the doctor away
191,around the same time refrigeration made possible a national market for apples and the industry got together and decided it would be wise to simplify that market by planting and promoting only a small handful of brand name varieties
192,that market had no use for the immense variety of qualities the nineteenth century apple embodied
193,now just two of these qualities counted beauty and sweetness
194,beauty in an apple meant a uniform redness by and large russeting now doomed even the tastiest apple
195,as for sweetness the complicated metaphorical resonance of that word had by now been flattened out mainly by the easy availability of cheap sugar
196,what had been a complex desire had become a mere craving a sweet tooth
197,sweetness in an apple now meant sugariness plain and simple
198,and in a culture of easy sweetness apples now had to compete with every other kind of sugary snack food in the supermarket even the touch of acid that gives the apple s sweetness some dimension fell out of favor
199,and so the red and golden delicious which are related only by the marketing genius of the stark brothers who named and trademarked them both and their exceptional sweetness came to dominate the vast grafted monoculture that the american orchard has become
200,apple breeders locked in a kind of sweetness arms race with junk food lean heavily on the genes of these two apples which can be found in most of the popular apples developed in the last few years including the fuji and the gala
201,thousands of apple traits and the genes that code those traits have become extinct as the vast flowering of apple diversity that johnny apple seed sponsored has been winnowed down to the small handful of varieties that can pass through the needle s eye of our narrow conceptions of sweetness and beauty
202,this is why the geneva orchard is a museum
203,today s commercial apples represent only a small fraction of the malus gene pool phil forsline its curator told me as we walked to a far corner of the orchard where there was something unusual he wanted me to see
204,forsline is a gangly horticulturist in his fifties with striking nordic blue eyes and sandy hair starting to gray
205,a century ago there were several thousand different varieties of apples in commerce now most of the apples we grow have the same five or six parents red delicious golden delicious jonathan macintosh and cox s orange pippin
206,breeders keep going back to the same well and it s getting shallower
207,forsline has devoted a career to preserving and expanding the apple s genetic diversity
208,he s convinced that the modern history of the apple particularly the practice of growing a dwindling handful of cloned varieties in vast orchards has rendered it less fit as a plant which is one reason modern apples require more pesticide than any other food crop
209,forsline explained why this is so
210,in the wild a plant and its pests are continually coevolving in a dance of resistance and conquest that can have no ultimate victor
211,but coevolution ceases in an orchard of grafted trees since they are genetically identical from generation to generation
212,the problem very simply is that the apple trees no longer reproduce sexually as they do when they re grown from seed and sex is nature s way of creating fresh genetic combinations
213,at the same time the viruses bacteria fungi and insects keep very much at it reproducing sexually and continuing to evolve until eventually they hit on the precise genetic combination that allows them to overcome whatever resistance the apples may have once possessed
214,suddenly total victory is in the pests sight unless that is people come to the tree s rescue wielding the tools of modern chemistry
215,put another way the domestication of the apple has gone too far to the point where the species fitness for life in nature where it still has to live after all has been dangerously compromised
216,reduced to the handful of genetically identical clones that suit our taste and agricultural practice the apple has lost the crucial variability the wildness that sexual reproduction confers
217,the solution is for us to help the apple evolve artificially forsline explained by introducing fresh genes through breeding
218,a century and a half after john chapman and others like him seeded the new world with apples underwriting the orgy of apple sex that led to the myriad new varieties represented in this orchard another genetic reshuffling may now be necessary
219,which is precisely why it is so important to preserve as many different apple genes as possible
220,it s a question of biodiversity forsline said as we walked down the long rows of antique apples tasting as we talked
221,i was accustomed to thinking of biodiversity in terms of wild species but of course the biodiversity of the domestic species on which we depend and which now depend on us is no less important
222,every time an old apple variety drops out of cultivation a set of genes which is to say a set of qualities of taste and color and texture as well as of hardiness and pest resistance vanishes from the earth
223,the greatest biodiversity of any species is typically found in the place where it first evolved where nature first experimented with all the possibilities of what an apple or a potato or peach could be
224,in the case of the apple the center of diversity as botanists call such a place lies in kazakhstan and in the last few years forsline has been working to preserve the wild apple genes that he and his colleagues have gathered in the kazakh forests
225,forsline has made several trips to the area bringing back thousands of seeds and cuttings that he has planted in two long rows all the way in the back of the geneva orchard
226,it was these trees apples far older and wilder than any planted by johnny appleseed that forsline wanted to show me
227,it was nikolai vavilov the great russian botanist who first identified the wild apple s eden in the forests around alma ata in kazakhstan in 1929
228,this wouldn t have come as news to the locals however alma ata means father of the apple
229,all around the city one could see a vast expanse of wild apples covering the foothills he wrote
230,one could see with his own eyes that this beautiful site was the origin of the cultivated apple
231,vavilov eventually fell victim to stalin s wholesale repudiation of genetics starving to death in a leningrad prison in 1943 and his discovery was lost to science until the fall of communism
232,in 1989 one of vavilov s last surviving students a botanist named aimak djangaliev invited a group of american plant scientists to see the wild apples he had been studying very quietly during the long years of soviet rule
233,djangaliev was already eighty and he wanted the americans help to save the wild stands of malus sieversii from a wave of real estate development spreading out from alma ata to the surrounding hills
234,forsline and his colleagues were astonished to find entire forests of apples three hundred year old trees fifty feet tall and as big around as oaks some of them bearing apples as large and red as modern cultivated varieties
235,even in the towns apple trees were coming up in the cracks of the sidewalks he recalled
236,you looked at these apples and felt sure you were looking at the ancestor of the golden delicious or the macintosh
237,forsline determined to save as much of this germ plasm as possible
238,he felt certain that somewhere among the wild apples of kazakhstan could be found genes for disease and pest resistance as well as apple qualities beyond our imagining
239,since the wild apple s survival in the wild was now in doubt he collected hundreds of thousands of seeds planted as many as he had space for in geneva and then offered the rest to researchers and breeders around the world
240,i ll send seeds to anybody who asks just so long as they promise to plant them tend to the trees and then report back someday
241,the wild apples had found their johnny appleseed
242,and then there they were two extravagantly jumbled rows of the weirdest apples i d ever laid eyes on
243,the trees had been crammed in cheek by jowl and the aisles could barely contain much less order the luxuriant riot of foliage and fruit even though it had been planted only six years before
244,i d never seen an orchard of apple seedlings few people nowadays ever do though it s hard to imagine another seedling orchard quite so crazed by diversity
245,forsline had told me that all the apple genes heretofore brought to america all the genes floating down the ohio river alongside john chapman represented maybe a tenth of the entire malus genome
246,well here was the rest of it
247,no two of these trees looked even remotely alike not in form or leaf or fruit
248,some grew straight for the sun others trailed along the ground or formed low shrubs or simply petered out the upstate new york climate not to their liking
249,i saw apples with leaves like those of linden trees others shaped like demented forsythia bushes
250,maybe a third of the trees were bearing fruit but strange strange fruit that looked and tasted like god s first drafts of what an apple could be
251,i saw apples with the hue and heft of olives and cherries alongside glowing yellow ping pong balls and dusky purple berries
252,i saw a whole assortment of baseballs oblate and conic and perfectly round some of them bright as infield grass others dull as wood
253,and i picked big shiny red fruits that looked just like apples of all things though their taste their taste was something else again
254,imagine sinking your teeth into a tart potato or a slightly mushy brazil nut covered in leather
255,on first bite some of these apples would start out with high promise on the tongue now here s an apple only to suddenly veer into a bitterness so profound it makes my stomach rise even in recollection
256,in the wild a plant and its pests are continually coevolving in a dance of resistance and conquest that can have no ultimate victor
257,but coevolution ceases in an orchard of grafted trees since they are genetically identical from generation to generation
258,the problem very simply is that the apple trees no longer reproduce sexually as they do when they re grown from seed and sex is nature s way of creating fresh genetic combinations
259,at the same time the viruses bacteria fungi and insects keep very much at it reproducing sexually and continuing to evolve until eventually they hit on the precise genetic combination that allows them to overcome whatever resistance the apples may have once possessed
260,suddenly total victory is in the pests sight unless that is people come to the tree s rescue wielding the tools of modern chemistry
261,put another way the domestication of the apple has gone too far to the point where the species fitness for life in nature where it still has to live after all has been dangerously compromised
262,reduced to the handful of genetically identical clones that suit our taste and agricultural practice the apple has lost the crucial variability the wildness that sexual reproduction confers
263,the solution is for us to help the apple evolve artificially forsline explained by introducing fresh genes through breeding
264,a century and a half after john chapman and others like him seeded the new world with apples underwriting the orgy of apple sex that led to the myriad new varieties represented in this orchard another genetic reshuffling may now be necessary
265,which is precisely why it is so important to preserve as many different apple genes as possible
266,it s a question of biodiversity forsline said as we walked down the long rows of antique apples tasting as we talked
267,i was accustomed to thinking of biodiversity in terms of wild species but of course the biodiversity of the domestic species on which we depend and which now depend on us is no less important
268,every time an old apple variety drops out of cultivation a set of genes which is to say a set of qualities of taste and color and texture as well as of hardiness and pest resistance vanishes from the earth
269,the greatest biodiversity of any species is typically found in the place where it first evolved where nature first experimented with all the possibilities of what an apple or a potato or peach could be
270,in the case of the apple the center of diversity as botanists call such a place lies in kazakhstan and in the last few years forsline has been working to preserve the wild apple genes that he and his colleagues have gathered in the kazakh forests
